     HAIL! PENNSYLVANIA


    Hail! Pennsylvania,
      Noble and strong!
    To thee with loyal hearts
      We raise our song.
    Swelling to heaven, loud
      Our praises ring;
    Hail! Pennsylvania,
      Of thee we sing!

    Majesty as a crown
      Rests on thy brow;
    Pride, Honor, Glory, Love,
      Before thee bow.
    Ne’er can thy spirit die,
      Thy walls decay;
    Hail! Pennsylvania,
      For thee we pray.

    Hail! Pennsylvania,
      Guide of our youth!
    Lead thou thy children on
      To light and truth;
    Thee when death summons us,
      Others shall praise,
    Hail! Pennsylvania,
      Through endless days!
            _Edgar M. Dilley, U. of P., 1897._

    _Proclaim the great “experiment” that wrought,_
    _As if by necromance ’mong doubting men,_

    _Yet hidden in very heart of Penn!_
    _And bear the message, flash it sea to sea,_

THE PLAN OF THE BOOK


This Guide Book of Art, Architecture, and Historic Interests in
Pennsylvania, commenced by advice of Mrs. Edward Biddle of Carlisle, and
fostered by Mrs. Samuel Semple of Titusville, during their presidency of
the “State Federation of Pennsylvania Women,” for the use of tourists,
is arranged chronologically, beginning with the counties first formed;
towns in each county follow each other in location as closely as
possible. Works of good art in the state have been catalogued, together
with a story of most interesting pioneer history, that each one of the
sixty-seven counties should have a chapter in the book; those that have
no art have the Indian trails and thrilling experiences of our first
brave pathfinders.

Serious effort has been made to have all the information verified; in
some instances, two or three counties have made the same claims for
various historic firsts, which have here been given their proper record,
through consultation with the State Historians at Harrisburg. To keep
the book small, facts are scarcely more than outlined; further
information about them may be obtained from the bibliography of this
book.

The chapter of each county was written by a most responsible person, who
lived there, judges, clergymen, historians, and a few by officers of the
women’s clubs, thus giving inside knowledge that a stranger could never
get. All dry-as-dust statistics are omitted, and only that which is of
prominent interest is given. Authorities consulted have differed, and
mistakes will occur; there will be sins of omission and commission in
the work, according to the point of view of the reader; but they are few
in comparison with the wealth of real information brought together
within this cover.

To the many earnest helpers who have given their knowledge, time and
patience in obtaining and sending these reports, warmest thanks and
sincere appreciation are heartily given; all honor is due to them. We
would like to give their names, but some have asked that they be
withheld and it is thought best to do so with all.

ADDENDA

This book, finished for publication in 1917, was placed in the vaults of
the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, as all money was needed for our
soldiers. The present committee, appointed by Mrs. Hamme, has decided to
publish the work as compiled in 1917, and not delay it by trying to
bring the sixty-seven counties up to date. Conditions have been so
unfavorable for new construction, since the war, that little has been
done. The population of towns, however, has been advanced to the 1920
statistics.

PHILADELPHIA HISTORIC FIRSTS


The first parks in North America provided for the pleasure of the people
were dedicated by William Penn at the settlement of Philadelphia in
1682. They were the North Eastern, South Eastern, North Western, South
Western, and Centre Squares, now known respectively as Franklin,
Washington, Logan, Rittenhouse, and Penn Squares.

In a letter dated 1683, William Penn alludes to the glass-house of the
Free Society of Traders. Soon after this a glass-house was erected at
Frankford by English Friends.

The first almanac printed in America was “Kalendarium Pennsilvaniense,
or, America’s Messinger. Being an Almanack for the Year of Grace, 1686.”
It was edited by Samuel Atkins, and published by William Bradford, 1685.

The first paper mill in America was built by William Rittenhouse, on the
banks of the Wissahickon Creek, in the year 1690.

“A new Primmer or Methodical Direction to attain the True Spelling,
Reading and Writing of English.” This was the first American school
textbook; though it was published in New York in 1698, its author was
Francis Daniel Pastorius, founder of Germantown.

The first presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in the United States was
formed in Philadelphia in 1705. It was composed of seven ministers, and
included Philadelphia, Maryland, Delaware, and the Eastern shore of
Virginia.

The first botanical garden in America was started in 1705 by Dr.
Christopher Witt, at the southeast corner of Germantown Avenue and High
Street. John Bartram began his famous gardens in 1728 at Gray’s Ferry on
the Schuylkill River.

The first Mennonite Church in America was erected in Germantown, at
Germantown Avenue and Herman Street, the first service being held
therein, May 23, 1708.

The first institution in America for the care of the poor was the
Friends’ Almshouse, established in Philadelphia in 1713.

First municipal care of the poor in the United States was begun by the
City of Philadelphia in a rented building September 1, 1713; the first
building was erected in 1731.

The first Dunkard (Tunker) Church in America was formed in Germantown,
December 25, 1723, at Germantown Avenue and Upsal Street. The first
love-feast celebrated in this country was observed by them the same
evening.

The first association for the benefit of workers (or labor organization)
in America was the “Carpenters’ Company,” established in Philadelphia,
in 1724.

The first mariner’s quadrant, invented by Thomas Godfrey, a glazier, of
Nineteenth Street and Church Lane, Germantown, was made in 1730. First
used in Delaware Bay by Joshua Fisher.

In 1727 a literary society was formed here by Franklin and eleven
associates. This was the famous “Junto,” and from it originated the
Library Company of Philadelphia, the first library of a public nature in
America. The instrument of association was dated July 1, 1731, and the
charter granted by the proprietary May 3, 1742.

from Bermuda in 1879 by Mrs. Mary Rogers, who propagated it until in
three years there were 100 specimens; then William K. Harris, a florist,
Fifty-sixth Street and Springfield Avenue, introduced it in both
Philadelphia and New York.

The Philadelphia Bourse, the first and, as yet, the only one in the
United States, was chartered June 25, 1891, and completed and opened for
business October 1, 1895.

The “Wistar Institute of Anatomy,” founded in 1892, by General Isaac
Wistar, and connected with the University of Pennsylvania, is the first
anatomical and neurological institute established in the United States.

Philadelphia was the first city to inaugurate a service by pneumatic
tubes for the general carriage of firstclass mail. A six-inch tube
connecting the Bourse station with the Central Post Office at Ninth
Street was put in service February 17, 1893, and is still in operation.
Eight-inch tubes have been used in lines since installed, and have a
capacity of 7,200,000 letters per day each way.

The first concrete arch highway bridge in the United States was built in
1893 by the City of Philadelphia at Pine Road over the Pennypack Creek.

The first institution established in the United States for the
advancement of business and trade in all branches, both domestic and
foreign, was the “Commercial Museum.” It was projected by Dr. William P.
Wilson, and established by ordinance of Philadelphia City Council,
approved June 15, 1894.

The first successful electric automobile was designed and built by two
Philadelphians, Henry G. Morris and Pedro G. Salom. It was patented
August 31, 1894.

The first hospital train sent out during the Spanish War, for the relief
of the fever-stricken soldiers in the mobilization camps, was sent by
the University of Pennsylvania, and the soldiers were brought to and
treated in the Hospital of that institution. This train left
Philadelphia August 17, 1898.

The first Automatic Restaurant (Automat) in America was opened June 9,
1902, at 818 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, by the Horn & Hardart Baking
Co.

THE COMMOMWEALTH, OR STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA (PENN’S WOODS)


With a royal grant for 40,000 square miles of land in the New World,
William Penn, thirty-eight years old, came up the Delaware River in 1682
and landed at the Blue Anchor Inn, built by the Swedes in 1636. The
state now covers 45,126 square miles.

No eastern state contains forests of such varied and abundant timber, or
extensive mineral deposits. According to official reports of the state
geologist, one and one-third billion dollars’ worth of mineral products
were taken from below ground in 1916; of these coal is the greatest
wealth producer, over $1,000,000,000 annually, the production being
nearly one-half that of the entire United States; the supply is still
ample and new fields are being opened. Over $100,000,000 in coke; and
more than $42,000,000 in its by-products. Petroleum counts for
$26,000,000. Gold, silver, platinum, and asbestos are found in small
quantities. Natural gas has been used in this state for manufacturing
purposes since 1874. This is the greatest manufacturing region in the
world, and has the richest agricultural land in the United States.
Pennsylvania stands first among the states in the Union in the number of
towns over 5000 in population, making it a remarkable selling market.
PHILADELPHIA, the chief city, and third in population, 1,823,779, in the

] States, is on the site of a village of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware
Indians, called Coaquanarck. Through William Penn’s liberal policy to
early settlers, and later being the seat of government of the United
States, many national institutions were originated here, and many more
historical buildings are here than in any other city in America. It
comprises the whole of Philadelphia County, and has a distinctive
character of its own, reminiscent of the old Quaker life, which is given
in this book in two Colonial Walks; the Revolutionary Period is given in
automobile routes, framed on Washington’s itinerary; and modern
institutions, many of them continuing from colonial times, are in
chapters, schools, galleries and museums, hospitals, libraries, music,
churches. Philadelphia was the leader in the fight for “Liberty of
Conscience.”

The obvious picturesqueness of Philadelphia is in the Pennsylvania
Hospital, Independence Hall, Christ Church, Old Swedes’, St. Peter’s.
Down in lower Spruce Street and neighboring streets are beautiful
colonial houses, stately doorways, decorative ironwork, dormer windows,
great gables, facing each other at street corners in harmonious
proportions. In not another town were the old streets so well worth
keeping unchanged. The early Friends, when they left England, packed up,
with their “Liberty of Conscience,” the love of beauty in architecture
and the money to pay for it. In a fine period of English architecture,
they got good English architects--Wren is said to have been of the
number--to design, not only their public buildings, but their private
houses; and carried over in their personal baggage, paneling, carvings,
ironwork, furniture and the various details they were not likely to
procure in Philadelphia.

Long straight lines of streets give the town serenity and repose.

NOTABLE ARCHITECTURE

Architecture should comprise beauty, fitness, and stability. It is
classified by various styles from the past, necessarily developed by
modern characterists. Eras of great national vigor invariably express
themselves architecturally, by means of great scale. To illustrate, the
Pyramids at Gizeh and the great temple at Karnak mark the zenith of
Egyptian civilization; the Parthenon echoes the halcyon days of Greece;
Imperial Rome boasted the Baths of Caracalla and the Colosseum; the
glorious Renaissance in Italy culminated in the grandeur of St. Peter’s
Church; and the consecration and craftsmanship of Gothic builders
crashed to earth with the lofty vaulting of Beauvais. Also consider, in
chronological order, the buildings of our own time, they present a mute
record of the ever-increasing virility of the nation; in the lacelike
tower of the Woolworth Building, piercing the blue heaven for a thousand
feet, we read the tremendous advance and limitless possibilities of the
country whose dreams become realities. Among the early COLONIAL or
GEORGIAN buildings are, CARPENTERS’ HALL, Chestnut Street below Fourth;
CHRIST CHURCH, Second Street above Market; HAMILTON MANSION in Woodlands
Cemetery, Thirty-ninth Street and Woodland Avenue; INDEPENDENCE HALL,
group, Chestnut Street between Fifth and Sixth; OLD SWEDES’ CHURCH
(Gloria Dei), Swanson Street near Front and Christian Streets;
PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL, Eighth and Pine Streets; ST. PETER’S CHURCH,
Third and Pine Streets.

limestone; architects, Thomas, Churchman, and Molitor.

=Classic.= ACADEMY OF MUSIC, Broad and Locust Streets. Interior classic;
brick; built, 1850; architects, LeBrun & Runge; the audience room is
very large, modeled after celebrated opera houses in Europe; plan of the
balconies is now considered obsolete, but the general effect is
undeniably fine, and has a flavor of the Second Empire. CATHEDRAL OF SS.
PETER AND PAUL, Logan Square; brownstone, built about 1860; architects,
Napoleon LeBrun for the building, John Notman for the façade; it is
impressive and dignified. UNITED STATES CUSTOM HOUSE, Chestnut Street
below Fifth; architect, John Haviland. GIRARD COLLEGE, Corinthian and
Girard Avenues; architect, Thomas U. Walters; modeled after the
Parthenon. GIRARD NATIONAL BANK, 116 South Third Street; portico of the
Third Street front is Corinthian, studied from the Parthenon and Temple
of Saturnus; it stands on a stylobate, elevated above the pavement by
steps on three sides, which gives it emphasis and dignity, and marks it
as the feature of approach to the building; this portico is flanked on
either side by a pavilion of pilasters, of the same character as the
columns of the portico, the space between the pilasters being pierced
with windows which are adorned with architraves and cornices supported
by carved brackets; the pilasters and columns are surmounted by a
cornice pediment and balustrade of great elegance of detail and
proportion, studied from the best class of Roman antique work; the
tympanum of the pediment is enriched by the date of the erection, 1795,
and the American eagle in bas-relief carving, of excellent modeling;
from the pavement to the apex of the portico is fifty-six feet; entire
front is of Pennsylvania blue marble; the building was erected for the
Bank of the United States in 1797, and followed closely the lines of the
Dublin Exchange; architect, Samuel Blodgett; marble work was done by
Claudius LeGrand in his yard at Tenth and Market Streets; this was the
first building in Philadelphia to be erected with portico and pillars;

COMPANY, northwest corner of Broad and Chestnut Streets, built in 1908;
architects, McKim, Mead & White, New York; Furness & Evans,
Philadelphia; has steel frame and Gustavino dome faced with white
marble; while the form of this building was probably suggested by the
Pantheon at Rome, details of the order are rather Greek, and the
colonetts, forming the mullions of the windows, suggest the Certosa di
Pavia. RIDGWAY LIBRARY, South Broad and Christian Streets, Doric; built,
1880; granite; architect, Addison Hutton. OLD STOCK EXCHANGE, Second,
Walnut and Dock Streets, white marble; has semicircular Corinthian
colonnade, and lantern modeled after the Temple of Lysicrates;

rug.

=Gothic.= ACADEMY OF THE FINE ARTS, Broad and Cherry Streets, Venetian

Italian and French influences; brick and Indiana limestone; architect,
Frank Miles Day. CITY HALL, open daily, 9.00 A.M. to 3.00 P.M., Broad

interest are the council chambers; mayor’s reception room, with

of the building, many scores of figures, symbolic of the history of this
nation

_Alexander Milne Calder, Sculptor_]

and the world, fine types of Indians, and other races; the negro heads
being known among artists as the best of their kind; ornamentation
symbolic of music, art, science, and commerce, is used as an integral
part of this great public edifice, an inherent factor in true
decoration, where it comes into its own, as well as in gardens, parks,
boulevards, and plazas. Statues outside, on City Hall pavement, are,
General John F. Reynolds, by Rogers; General McClellan; the Pilgrim by
Saint Gaudens; the Quaker by Giuseppe Donato; Stephen Girard and John

much to the architectural attraction of West Philadelphia; entrances to
the campus, near the dormitories, are fine Tudor gateways, wrought iron,

cathedrals, and use them for office buildings.” THE SKYSCRAPERS.
ADELPHIA HOTEL, Thirteenth and Chestnut Streets, Italian Renaissance,

faced with white marble and brick; built, 1910; architect, Edgar V.
Seeler; faces Independence Square, and although thoroughly modern,
harmonizes perfectly, both in color and design, with the historic
Georgian group, of which Independence Hall is the center, and adds to
the quiet colonial atmosphere of the Square; interior is excellently
designed; entrance, lobby, editorial offices, and the employes’ dining
room being of particular interest. Mechanical equipment is the finest of
its kind in the world, producing an average of 5,558,600 complete paid

Evening Post_, and _The Country Gentleman_ for six months ending June
30, 1924. Twenty original paintings, and the mosaic “The Dream Garden,”

of the Adam Brothers; built, 1912; steel frame, faced with colonial

STEPHEN GIRARD BUILDING, Twelfth and Girard Streets, modern adaptation
of Greek classic; built about 1894; steel frame, faced with brick and
marble; architect, John T. Windrim; details of this building are

adaptation of Italian Renaissance, built, 1910; steel frame, with light
gray granite; architects, D. H. Burnham & Co., Chicago; exterior of this
store is one of the finest in the city, it is simple, dignified, and
impressive, without being monotonous; the great scale of the Doric order
at the base, the severe wall treatment, and the splendid cornice,
combine to express a purity and loftiness seldom equaled in commercial
buildings; a guide may be had, upon application, who will conduct
visitors through the entire building including the kitchens. WEST
PHILADELPHIA HIGH SCHOOL, Forty-sixth and Walnut Streets, Tudor Gothic;
rough brick and Indiana limestone; built, 1913, by the City Architect.
WIDENER MEMORIAL HOME for crippled children, Broad Street and Olney
Avenue, Georgian, built, 1906; Harvard brick and marble trimmings;
architect, Horace Trumbauer; has a very beautifully designed wrought
iron gateway.

To make a “City Beautiful” is to give it wide streets, lined with
handsome buildings and houses, plenty of parks, boulevards, and to rid
it of rows upon rows of semi-shanty premises, small, ill-kept, and
unattractive. Each new building that is put up within the city limits
should, in its arrangements and architecture, help toward making the
locality in which it is erected more attractive than at the present
time. This idea has been carried out in the CARNEGIE FREE LIBRARY
buildings, scattered about within the limits of the municipality, as
their varied exteriors are very distinguished, from an architectural
point. The interiors are designed to avoid the multiplication of
corridors; principal rooms used for reading, the art and reference
rooms, are stately and fine.

An interesting GATEWAY is the entrance to the MANHEIM CRICKET CLUB,
Germantown, Georgian; consisting of massive brick piers, surmounted by
stone caps, connected at the top with a wrought iron supporting lantern,
below which are the heavy wrought iron central gates; this, with smaller
gateways, and a most attractive brick wall, forms the enclosure for the
grounds; architects, McKim, Mead & White.

small measure the history of American art itself, and dates back to
1791, when Charles Willson Peale attempted to organize in Philadelphia a
school of art; from this grew, in 1794, the Columbianum, which held the
first exhibition of paintings, in 1795, in Independence Hall. The
permanent collection of paintings and sculpture now includes the Gallery
of National Portraiture, with the largest number of portraits by Gilbert
Stuart to be seen in any museum; and notable works by other early
American painters--Benjamin West, Washington Allston, Matthew Pratt, the
Peales, Sully, Neagle, Inman, Eichholz, Trumbull, and Bass Otis; the
Gibson Collection, largely composed of the Continental schools; Temple
collection of modern American paintings; important works by many of the
world’s greatest artists; and the Phillips collection of about forty
thousand etchings and engravings. Annual exhibitions are, miniatures,
water colors, illustration, and etchings in November and December; oil
painting and sculpture in February and March, considered the salon of
living American artists; also special exhibitions and lectures on art.
The Academy coöperates with the system of International Catalogue
Exchange.

Since the beginning of the Academy’s existence, men and women whose
names have become illustrious in the annals of American art have been
enrolled as students. The schools are equipped in every way to teach the
technique of painting and sculpture, the faculty is composed of
representative artists of the day; collections, galleries, classrooms,
models, and casts are admirably fitted to afford instruction fully equal
to that obtainable in Europe. Many substantial prizes are awarded
annually to students upon the merits of their work. The William Emlen
Cresson Travelling Scholarships send, on an average, sixteen students
abroad yearly for four months, and enable them to return to the Academy
and continue their studies without payment of tuition fee. The
Fellowship of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, organized 1897,
sends out annually two exhibitions of original oil paintings by notable
artists; one to other cities, the other to the Philadelphia public
schools, where they remain one month in each school; while there, the
paintings are explained by a member of the Fellowship to school
children, thus teaching them true appreciation of art. A Picture
Purchase Fund was established in 1912, with which pictures have been
bought, from Fellowship Exhibitions, and placed in Philadelphia
libraries and public schools.

JOHN GRAVER JOHNSON MUSEUM OF PAINTINGS, 510 South Broad Street, left by
bequest April, 1917, to the City of Philadelphia, is open to the public;
throughout Europe and America this vast collection of old and modern
masters is famous for extent and merit. “No other American collection
has so wide a range and so even a quality,” says F. Mason Perkins; it
contains scores of examples which could not be duplicated at any price.
Noted for the completeness of different schools of painting.

PHILADELPHIA SCHOOL OF DESIGN FOR WOMEN, southwest corner of Broad and
Master Streets; first industrial art school in this country; similar to
the “Ecoles Professionelles des Femmes,” in Paris; was founded in 1844
by Mrs. Sarah Peters, the American wife of the British Consul in
Philadelphia, in her own house; later, the Franklin Institute assumed
charge of the classes until 1853, when it was incorporated, and a Board
of Directors elected. Its aim is to put art students in touch with
business demands, as well as to cultivate, to the highest degree, their
artistic ability. The Normal Art Course embodies all the special studies
required by modern educators for teachers of art and design, and with
courses in the fine arts, illustration, and costume illustration; has
trained many women, now earning handsome emoluments and winning
distinction. The residence on Broad Street, forming entrance to the
school, which occupies large buildings in the rear, was the home of
Edwin Forrest, a famous tragedian; the fine gallery which he erected to
house his collection of paintings, now at the Forrest Home for Actors at
Holmesburg, is used for annual exhibitions of the school’s painting
classes. Edwin Forrest died here in 1872 and John Sartain in 1897; John
Sartain was celebrated as a mezzotint engraver, and lived here with his
daughter, Miss Emily Sartain, then principal of the school, herself a
skilled painter, and engraver in mezzotint; who with her well chosen
faculty of eminent artists, carried to a prosperous fulfilment Mrs.
Peters’ initiative effort.

PENNSYLVANIA MUSEUM AND SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART was founded in 1876, as
a concrete embodiment of the lessons taught by the Centennial
Exhibition, and has developed forms of artistic craftsmanship that were
practically unknown in America. The Museum is housed in Memorial Hall,
Fairmount Park, memorial of the Centennial; Modern Renaissance;
architect, Herman J. Schwarzmann. Open free, Mondays, 12.00 M., other
days 9.30 A.M., closing 5.00 P.M., Sundays, 1.00 P.M. to 6.00 P.M.
Established as a museum of art in all its branches and technical
application, with a special view to the development of the art
industries of the state. Among its important collections are the W. P.
Wilstach paintings, about five hundred old masters, with their schools;
and contemporary international paintings, belonging to the City of
Philadelphia; with $700,000 endowment, interest to be used for their
care and increase, by the Commissioners of Fairmount Park; among the
many brilliant artists represented are, Whistler, Munkácsy, Sorolla,
Zuloago, Velasquez, the Barbizon, Italian, and Dutch Schools of
Landscape. The famous Bayeux tapestry is here; laces; vestments;
porcelains; enamels; carved ivories; period furniture; some of the Edwin
Atlee Barber collection of American pottery and porcelains; Lewis
collection of Swiss stained glass, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries;
Frishmuth collection of colonial antiquities. A Bureau of Identification
is maintained where art objects may be classified.

The school is at the northwest corner of Broad and Pine Streets; porch
of this building, facing Broad Street, is a fine example of Tuscan
architecture, erected, 1828. The school has forty instructors. Free
scholarships are given in each county of this state. This is the leading
school in America in associating the study of art with practical
training; through its equipment students not only design, but actually
manufacture; it includes a complete textile plant with looms, dye house,
and all related appliances which make possible the production of most
artistic fabrics; other courses are cast and wrought metal; furniture;
leather work; pottery; garden furniture in cement; mosaic; also the
Normal Art Courses, illustration; architectural drawing; modeling;
interior decoration; book binding. Classes are attended by men and
women, who pursue exactly the same studies. Graduates are sought to fill
lucrative positions as designers; artistic craftsmen; and art teachers.

DREXEL INSTITUTE, Thirty-second and Chestnut Streets. A day and evening
technical school of Art, Science, and Industry for men and women;
founded by Anthony J. Drexel, 1891; Renaissance, brick; architects,
Wilson Brothers. The leading American and European current periodicals
relating to art, science, and technology are in the library. Art Gallery
contains collections owned by John D. Lankenau, works by modern German
masters, and Anthony J. Drexel, works of International, contemporary,
modern painters. The Museum, open free 10.00 A.M. to 5.00 P.M. daily,
except Sundays, includes examples of Industrial Art and the Decorative
Arts of India, Egypt, China, Japan, and Europe.

GRAPHIC SKETCH CLUB, 719 Catharine Street, founded by Samuel S. Fleisher
in 1899, to provide, free, an art center which should give the culture
craved by many intelligent young people, to whom it had been denied by
circumstances. The Club House is open only at night, Saturday
afternoons, and all day Sundays. This is an Art Club in effect, as well
as name; rooms are artistically furnished in beautiful color harmonies,
and embellished with choice bronzes bought at our Academy exhibitions,
and fine porcelains. Students are educated in art, for the practical
good it will do them, and cultural growth; all are day workers. The
faculty is composed of well known artists; classes include portrait and
still life painting; illustration and sculpture. From this school have
gone some of the most original workers in the schools of the Academy of
the Fine Arts. Landscape classes are in session during the summer.
Lectures are given on art or musical topics. Membership in the Club is
attained by attendance in the classes for three years.

PUBLIC ART SCHOOL, Park Avenue and Master Street, founded by Charles G.
Leland, now under the direction of the Board of Public Education; open
to pupils in grammar grades of public schools. A course of study was
planned, including drawing, clay modeling, and wood carving, to train
students to originate design, and do the manual work as well, so that
the designer should be the artisan also.

ART CLUB, 220 South Broad Street. Annual exhibition of paintings and
sculpture, gold medal awarded; and special shows by individual artists.

ART JURY, City Hall, Philadelphia, created by Act of Legislature, 1907,

Valley Forge, and in Philadelphia may be mentioned St. Mark’s Protestant
Episcopal Church, Frankford; St. James’ Protestant Episcopal Church,
Twenty-second and Walnut Streets; St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church,
Twentieth and Locust Streets; Synagogue Rodeph Shalom, Philadelphia.

WILLIAM WILLET AND ANNIE LEE WILLET STUDIOS, FOR STAINED GLASS, 226
South Eleventh Street, formerly of Pittsburgh. While all the world is
deploring the loss of the magnificent old glass in the cathedrals of
Europe, here the art of fused glass has been raised to such perfection
that their great windows have all that the old work has, of depth, glow,
and shadow, under modern conditions of stability; among their notable
windows are, the Sanctuary Window, West Point Military Chapel, New York;
Proctor Hall, the Graduate School, Princeton, New Jersey, great west
window; many in the churches and public buildings of Pittsburgh, Chicago
and elsewhere; in and near Philadelphia, in Summit Presbyterian Church,

are:

[Illustration: THE TRAGIC MUSE

From the Edward Hornor Coates Memorial Collection

_Painted by Violet Oakley_ _Courtesy of the Pennsylvania Academy of the
Fine Arts_]

P. A. B. WIDENER’S, several hundred choice and rare paintings, mostly
masterpieces of great artists of the Renaissance, and modern.

The W. L. ELKINS; many fine examples of medieval and modern portraiture,
landscape and genre painting.

The JOHN MCFADDEN, best collection of solely eighteenth century English
paintings in this country.

The EDWARD T. STOTESBURY, masterpieces of the English School and
international contemporary art.

Should these collections accompany the WILSTACH, now in Memorial Hall,
to the Municipal Art Museum in Fairmount Park, now under construction,
it would begin its career with a wealth of paintings, more comprehensive
and valuable than any that ever inaugurated a similar institution, not
excepting the Louvre, Pitti, Dresden, National in London, and
Metropolitan, New York, which grew from small beginnings, thus placing
the highest products of art within equal and easy reach of all classes.
This Museum will constitute the central feature of a comprehensive plan
in progress, at the head of the Parkway, for a real art center, more
imposing in scale and impressive in its entire effect than any similar
art center in any American City. The PENNSYLVANIA ACADEMY OF THE FINE
ARTS has been granted a site facing the Fairmount Plaza, also the
PENNSYLVANIA MUSEUM AND SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART.


ARMY AND NAVY

THE FIRST CITY TROOP, Armory, Twenty-third Street, above Chestnut;
founded in 1778. An exclusive social organization. Oldest military
command in the United States in continuous active service; its
traditions of active service are as loyally preserved as its rights as
escort of the President, and other distinguished men. In the
Spanish-American War in 1898, “The Troop” was the first body of cavalry
landed at Porto Rico. The “Gentlemen of Philadelphia” met in
Independence Hall, November 17, 1774, and formed a company of cavalry
called, “The Light Horse of the City of Philadelphia”; they were
dismissed by Washington after the Revolution in 1778, and reorganized
immediately as the First City Troop; the Troop voted to give the
certificate of dismissal, signed by Washington, to their captain, Samuel
Morris; the paper is now in possession of the decendants of Elliston P.
Morris, of Germantown. FRANKFORD ARSENAL, Bridge and Tacony Streets;
local station, Bridesburg; open, free, daily, 7.45 A.M. to sunset.
Established, 1814; President Madison was at the opening exercises.
Lafayette stopped at the Arsenal in 1824. Here are complete small arms
cartridge factory equipment; artillery cartridge factory equipment; and
machine plant for the manufacture of inspecting instruments; sights for
cannon; range finders; and other instruments for fire control at the
fortifications, etc. PHILADELPHIA NAVY YARD, League Island, about 1000
acres; junction of Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers; deeded to the
National Government by the City of Philadelphia in 1868. Open to the
public daily between 9.00 A.M. and 4.00 P.M. Established about 1794 on
the Delaware River front, at Prime Street. A large number of the old
wooden ships of the Navy were built here, such as the ships of the line,
_Franklin_, _Pennsylvania_ and _North Carolina_; frigates, _United
States_, _Raritan_, and _Guerriere_; sloops of war, _Vandalia_,
_Germantown_, and _Dale_; screw steamers, _Princeton_, _Wabash_, and
_Lancaster_; side wheel steamers, _Mississippi_ and _Susquehanna_. At
present there are two dry docks; shops employ 2000 men; three large
barrack buildings for the use of marines stationed at the Yard
accommodate 1400 men. Admiral Benson, former Commandant, considers this
the best Navy Yard in the Government’s possession, being in the center
of coal and iron industries, within short haul, both by rail and water,
for all material required by a great navy yard; its nearness to great
private shipyards on the Delaware provides skilled mechanics in the art
of ship-building, and the fresh water feature, being unique, is of great
importance; barnacles accumulated in salt water drop off in fresh water,
simply by docking here for short periods. There is also a large Reserve
Basin called the Back Channel, where ships out of commission can be laid
up until wanted. The berthing facilities may be indefinitely extended by
constructing additional sea wall and piers. FORT MIFFLIN, below mouth of
the Schuylkill, has casement dungeons, and earthen banks of early
warfare, and was prominent in the Revolutionary War; designed and built
by Major Louis de Tousard in 1798. Now, in the magazines, ammunition
from government battleships is stored, before they enter the Navy Yard;
the magazines are surrounded by poles, on each pole is a lightning rod.
UNITED STATES NAVAL ASYLUM, Gray’s Ferry Avenue below Bainbridge Street,
classic, marble; has Museum of Uniforms.

site for the present locality, the bodies were moved whenever possible,
and many of the old headstones were inserted in the south wall of the
new graveyard. The Third Church, called “Old Pine,” divides the grounds,
using the west section; both are most interesting, with many people of
note interred, including David Rittenhouse; William Hurry, who is said

once residence of Commodore Stephen Decatur. HOOD, or “THE LOWER BURIAL
GROUND,” on Germantown Avenue at Logan Street, opened in 1693, having
been presented to the borough of Germantown by Jan Streepers. Many early
settlers of Germantown lie here; among them Frederic William Post, the
Moravian missionary to the Indians, and Condy Raguet, founder of the
Saving Fund in Philadelphia; in 1847, William Hood built the front
entrance, of Pennsylvania marble, the wall and railing. IVY HILL, East

laid out a town and named it Kensington; his daughter carried out his
wishes, and bequeathed ground for a burial place for those living in
Kensington. RONALDSON’S, Tenth and Fitzwater Streets, now neglected,
was founded by James Ronaldson in 1826 as a burial place in which
persons of moderate means could find a grave without any of the
restrictions which attended interments in the churchyards; he gave the
ground, almost a city square, decorated it with trees and shrubbery; so
beautifully was it kept that it was considered “The model burial place
of the City,” until the opening of Laurel Hill. UPPER BURIAL GROUND, or
AX’S, Germantown Avenue near Washington Lane. John Frederick Ax was
caretaker from 1724-56; many early settlers are buried here, the oldest

HISTORIC CHURCHES IN PHILADELPHIA

Among the eight hundred and five churches in Philadelphia, are:

The Philadelphia BAPTIST, whose Association celebrated its two
hundredth and tenth anniversary in 1917. FIRST CHURCH, Seventeenth
Street below Chestnut, open daily, is a consistent example of Byzantine
architecture with American modifications; stone; architect, Edgar V.
Seeler. Windows made by Heinecke & Bowen are copies of the Byzantine
leaded glass; lights and shadows in drapery are all done with leaded
strips of glass, not painted. TEMPLE, Broad and Berks Streets, famous on

people: Romanesque, with two low towers on the front, surmounted by
large copper domes, which give an Oriental touch; architect, Thomas
Lonsdale. Fine rose window in front, said to have been made by John
LaFarge; other windows are by J. & R. Lamb and R. S. Groves: the
Hope-Jones organ, built by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company, is one of the

=Friends’ or Quaker Meeting-Houses.=

    “What dignity breathes from the lofty space
     And amplitude of hospitality
     In these old-fashioned Quaker shrines!
     Most friendly seems the long, high, sturdy roof,
     Most friendly the all-welcoming old walls
     Seen through the sheltering trees.
     O mighty oaks and noble sycamores,
     With trunks moss-silvered and with lichened limb,
     Breathe soft to me the storied memories
     And treasured records of the long rich years
     That blessed the meeting-houses.”
              (From “Old Meeting-Houses,”
                 by John Russell Hayes.)

For more than one hundred years there has been no change in the general
style of architecture; before that time, the earliest meeting-house in
Philadelphia, at Second and Market Streets, was built with a central
lantern or cupola; probably copied from a meeting-house of similar form
in Burlington, New Jersey, built, 1682; where the yearly meeting for New
Jersey and Pennsylvania was first held: later it met alternately at
Philadelphia and Burlington, but since 1750 in Philadelphia, Fourth and
Arch Streets. One of the most interesting old meeting-houses, built in
1696, is at MERION, near Narberth Station, Pennsylvania Railroad, in
which William Penn preached; another, that he attended, is the old
HAVERFORD, built in the early eighteenth century, near Cobb’s Creek,
opposite St. Dennis Roman Catholic Church. RADNOR and PLYMOUTH are also
interesting old houses; all these last named are now owned by the
HICKSITE BRANCH of Quakers, who also own over seventy other
meeting-houses throughout the state. Among those owned by the ORTHODOX
BRANCH within Philadelphia are the Fourth and Arch Streets, not only the
most important, but of great charm architecturally; it is very large and
stands on ground originally given by William Penn to George Fox, and by
the latter to Friends in America; and may be taken as typical of the
later and best Quaker architecture; built in 1804, following the style
of the pre-Revolutionary days of the houses just named, but adapted in
material and size to the increased numbers worshiping within; it is of
brick, set in ample grounds, with abundant shade; the ground about it,
and much also covered now by the building and by Arch Street, is a very
old burial ground, filled over several times. James Logan is buried
under the pavement of Arch Street. TWELFTH STREET MEETING-HOUSE, brick,
built in 1812, is second in importance, and one of the most beautiful
bits in old Philadelphia. The oak timbers in its roof are said to have
come from the “Great Meeting-House,” which succeeded that with the
cupola at Second and Market Streets; oak timbers are also exposed with
good effect in the upper room of the Arch Street house; the two houses
are of the same general type and severely plain, but form, together with
that at Sixth and Noble Streets, a most dignified trio of places for
worship; remarkable for true proportion and dignity of outline, they are
typical of the wealth and solidity of the Friends at their most
flourishing period. THE MEETING HOUSE, Sixth and Noble Streets, known
as “North Meeting,” once accommodating a large congregation, has been
reduced in members by removals; the Yearly Meeting has therefore taken
over its use as an adjunct to the settlement work, carried on by Friends
at “Noble House.”

=Jewish.= Rosh Hashana, or the Jewish New Year’s Day, is the oldest
festival celebrated in the civilized world, 1917 will usher in the year
5678; it commences the great series of fall holidays: ten days later is
“Yom Kippur,” the Day of Atonement, most sacred of the year, when the
Jews fast from sunset to sunset and attend the synagogues, and a week
later “Succoth,” corresponding to our Thanksgiving Day, which lasts a
week. The principal synagogues are ADATH-JESHURUN, Broad Street above
Diamond, Egyptian; limestone and brick; architects, Churchman, Thomas &
Molitar, has leaded glass windows by Nicolo D’Ascenzo. KENESETH ISRAEL,

native of Bremen, who studied in Rome under Thorwaldsen; and recumbent
effigy of Colonel Burd; also font by Steinhauser, represents three
cherubs supporting on their wings a large marble bowl, with sculpture in
relief; the church, decorated by Frank Furness, with color, rich and
unusual, sets off admirably the beauty of the memorial marbles; the
stately reredos, with its brilliant Venetian mosaic picture, “The Last
Supper,” was made in 1889, by Salviati, Venice, from cartoons by Henry
Holiday, London, and under his own supervision; large double window in
transept also by Holiday; a Tiffany window is, “Christ Among the
Lilies,” the only flower He mentions in the Evangels, and accepted as

Axel Ender, over the altar of a church in Molde, Northern Norway; near
the reredos is “The Angel of Purity,” sculptor Augustus Saint Gaudens,
which suggests his “Amor, Caritas,” owned by the French Government, now
in the Luxembourg; here is also a bas-relief by Charles Grafley of Dr.
David D. Wood, organist of St. Stephen’s for forty-six years; the great
organ was built by C. T. Haskell, Philadelphia, in consultation with Dr.
Wood; pipes were voiced in the church, resulting in a sweetness and just
proportion of tone; its echo organ, located about two hundred feet away,
is in the loft over the chancel. Parish house is on site of the old
graveyard, tombstones are in pavement of cloister; architect, George C.
Mason, Jr. TRINITY, Oxford, Oxford Road and Second Street Pike;

1714, it is probably the last one she sent to America, and has been used
in every Holy Communion for over two centuries. Tiffany altar window,
“The Baptism of Christ.” The altar, of walnut and oak, is beautifully
carved. This is the mother of many flourishing missions, St. Luke’s,
Germantown; Our Saviour, Jenkintown; St. Mark’s, Frankford; Emmanuel,
Holmesburg; Holy Trinity, Rockledge; and Trinity Chapel, Crescentville;
today it stands, vigorous and full of life, in its old age, greatly
enlarged and carefully restored; the utmost care has been taken to
disturb none of the old walls, and to keep the historic features intact;
the glass, in the body of the church, is an opaque yellow, harmonizing
with the colonial buff of the walls and barrel ceiling. The churchyard
is of great interest, one stone, dated, 1686, is said to mark the grave
of an Indian.

=The Reformed Church in the United States=, which brought its beautiful
and significant emblem, “The lily among thorns,” from the fatherland, is
derived from the Reformed Churches of Switzerland and Germany; these
churches are largely to be found in the counties east of the Susquehanna
River. William Penn’s mother, Margaret Jasper, was reared in this faith;
noted members who came here were Michael Schlatter, in 1746, from St.
Gall, Switzerland; sent to establish an ecclesiastical organization; he
was practically the first superintendent of public instruction in
Pennsylvania; died, 1790, and was buried in the Reformed graveyard in
Philadelphia, now Franklin Square; Colonel Henry Bouquet, from
Switzerland, proved the saviour of the early settlers in Pontiac’s war
and obtained the restoration of all captives to their homes; three
hundred and seventy were brought back; and Baron von Steuben, who had
served on the staff of Frederick the Great at the siege of Prague,
drilled our men into efficiency to cope with the British regulars; later
he commanded at the Siege of Yorktown, which he pressed so vigorously
that Cornwallis was obliged to surrender. Zion Reformed Church at
Allentown sheltered our Liberty Bell and the Christ Church bells during
the Revolution; among their thirty churches in Philadelphia and
vicinity, of Gothic architecture, stone, are the FIRST CHURCH, Fiftieth
and Locust Streets; oldest of this denomination in Philadelphia; moved
from Tenth and Wallace Streets; PALATINATE, Fifty-sixth Street and
Girard Avenue; ST. JOHN’S, Fortieth and Spring Garden Streets; and
TRINITY, northeast corner of Broad and Venango Streets. There are also
five churches of the Dutch Reformed.

=Roman Catholic.= The churches of this denomination are all notable for
good architecture, interior sumptuous, ecclesiastical decoration.
CATHEDRAL OF SS. PETER AND PAUL, finely situated on Logan Square and the
Parkway; Classic Renaissance, brownstone; built 1846-64; architect,
Napoleon LeBrun; “The Crucifixion,” back of the high altar, genuine
fresco painting, is by Constantine Brumidi, who, about the same time,
executed important decorations, in the same medium, in the dome of the
Capitol at Washington; on entering the church, in chapels on both sides
of the door, are mural decorations by Henry J. Thouron, said, by high
authority, to be the best mural paintings in the United States; the
first was placed in 1911 as a fitting background for a statue of the
Virgin and Child by Louis Madrazzi, which Mr. Thouron brought from Paris
as a gift to the Cathedral; in the north transept is a painting, “The
Dead Christ,” attributed to Titian; a work of art of exceptional merit
is a large ivory crucifix, the master work of Carlo Pazenti, an
Augustinian lay brother, about 1840; acquired for the church, with much
difficulty, by the venerable John N. Neumann, fourth Bishop of
Philadelphia; when, during the Civil War, the Sanitary Fair was being
held in Logan Square, Archbishop Wood, then Bishop Wood, exhibited this
beautiful work daily, for the benefit of the great cause; it was
returned each evening to its place in the Cathedral. ST. JOHN THE
EVANGELIST, Thirteenth Street above Chestnut, for a short time the
cathedral; early English, Gothic; interior, perpendicular Gothic;
cornerstone laid by Bishop Kenrick, third Bishop of Philadelphia; church
opened April 8, 1832: a flagellation of Christ, much darkened, by
Garacci, was presented to the church by Joseph Bonaparte soon after its
completion: Mozart’s “Requiem Mass” was rendered, for the first time in
America, at St. John’s Church, and the music there today, is said to be
the best church music in Philadelphia. ST. PATRICK’S, Twentieth Street
below Locust, originated in a frame church in 1839, on east side of
Nineteenth Street near Spruce; the seventy-fifth anniversary was
celebrated in 1916, was attended by many notable dignitaries of the
church. Windows by d’Ascenzo. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES, Forty-seventh Street
and Springfield Avenue, Romanesque, with Byzantine details; built,
1907-10; architect, Henry D. Dagit, Philadelphia; the leaded glass is
particularly beautiful; windows are of the antique school and extremely
rich in color, including four rose windows, designed and made by Nicolo
d’Ascenzo, Philadelphia. Four old historic churches rather near
together, ST. JOSEPH’S, on Willing’s Alley, south of Walnut, below
Fourth Street; built on site of first Roman Catholic Church in
Pennsylvania, established by a member of the “Society of Jesus” from
Maryland, in 1731; ST. MARY’S, Fourth Street, above Spruce; ST.
AUGUSTINE’S, Fourth Street, above Race; and HOLY TRINITY, northwest
corner of Sixth and Spruce Streets, had their origin in the eighteenth
century, the first two long before the Revolution. St. Augustine’s is on
site of a building erected in 1801, by the hermits of the Order of St.
Augustine; it had William Rush’s wooden sculpture “The Crucifixion,” but
this was burned in 1847. Holy Trinity, German, is of somewhat earlier
date; the wayfarer who now looks in on any of them may readily picture
them as they were over one hundred years ago. In St. Mary’s Church is a
very fine pieta by Boucher, a modern French sculptor.

=Swedenborgian=, or The New Church, grew out of the teachings of Emmanuel
Swedenborg, scholar, traveler, scientist, and religious writer, born in
Stockholm, Sweden, in 1688. A school of the New Church was started in
Philadelphia in 1854. FIRST “NEW JERUSALEM” CHURCH, Twenty-second and
Chestnut Streets, Gothic, brownstone, was built in 1884; architect,
Theophilus P. Chandler. Connected with it is a free library and reading
room.

=Unitarian.= FIRST CHURCH, Chestnut Street near Twenty-second, built,
1885; was organized, 1796, in a room of the University of Pennsylvania;
in 1797 Dr. Joseph Priestly delivered an address to this Society, and
enrolled himself among the members. William Henry Furness was ordained
pastor in 1825, in the church at the corner of Tenth and Locust Streets;
present church contains some interesting memorials, Dr. Furness, bust by
M. Launt Thompson, New York; circular window to Dr. Priestly by John
LaFarge; other windows are English; and some are by Tiffany, New York.
GIRARD AVENUE UNITARIAN, Girard Avenue above Fifteenth Street, organized
by the Rev. Charles G. Ames, in the late seventies; Gothic, granite.
GERMANTOWN UNITARIAN, corner of Chelten Avenue and Greene Street, built,
1866; Gothic; architect, Frank Furness; has good stained glass windows,
made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, London. Rev. Samuel Longfellow,
brother of the poet, was pastor for some years; also the Rev. Charles G.
Ames.


FAIRMOUNT PARK

On east and west banks of the Schuylkill River, and Wissahickon Creek;
second largest municipal park in the world, 3597 acres; its only
superior in acreage being Blue Hills Park, Boston, with 4906 acres. The
ravines, “unkempt and wild,” all have springs of clear, cold water. Main
entrance at Green Street is also approach to the proposed PHILADELPHIA
MUSEUM OF ART, on a raised terrace, like a Greek Temple, facing the
Parkway; Horace Trumbauer, C. C. Zantzinger, and Charles L. Borie, Jr.,
architects; part of the plan for development of Philadelphia within a
radius of thirty miles: here also is the “Washington Monument,”
sculptor, Professor Siemering of Berlin, erected by the “Society of the
Cincinnati.” Continue drive, to the Schuylkill River, proposed Ericsson
Memorial, Paul B. Cret, architect, was commissioned to prepare a design
for development of the entire basin, from boat houses to Spring Garden
Street, including the AQUARIUM, formed, 1911, using the classic marble
buildings of the old waterworks; it is said to be the best equipped in
the world; walls of exhibition tanks are covered with calcareous tufa,
rock shell formation from the Ohio River Valley, full of holes, in which
deep water vegetation is planted to suggest sea bottom; Arctic and
tropical life have their own temperatures; also hatching rooms. This
tract and Rocky Hill, of the old waterworks, five acres, between Green
and Callowhill Streets, was named by William Penn, FAIR MOUNT; it was
used as the terminal pillar of the British redoubts, stretching across
the city from the Schuylkill to the Delaware, in 1777-78. Acquired by
the city in 1812 as site for the city waterworks, moved from Centre
Square, for park purposes. This was the beginning of Fairmount Park; to
beautify the grounds, walks were laid out up to the reservoir, and the
rock decorated with sculpture, chiefly woodcarving, by William Rush,
including the groups, “The Schuylkill in an Improved State,” and “The
Schuylkill in Chains,” which are still over the entrances to the wheel
houses; “Justice” and “Wisdom,” full-length statues, carved for
decoration of the triumphal arch in front of the State House at
Lafayette’s reception in 1824, are now in the hatching room; and “Leda
and the Swan,” modeled in 1812 from Miss Vanuxen, a Philadelphia belle,
a bronze reproduction is here now. Boat houses are of decorative
construction. THE SCHUYLKILL NAVY, said to be the most complete
association devoted to rowing in the world, is the center for test
trials of skill and endurance, of national interest; it is known as the
American Henley; the course above Columbia Avenue bridge is ideal for
oarsmen, and the banks rise like seats of an auditorium. On the main
drive from the Aquarium are the LINCOLN MONUMENT, bronze, sculptor,
Randolph Rogers, made in Rome, cast in Munich; Iron Spring, and a bronze
group, “Lioness Carrying to Her Young a Wild Boar,” sculptor, August
Cain; near Brown Street entrance is bronze group, “Silenus and the
Infant Bacchus”; original in the Louvre, credited to Praxiteles; and the
bronze group, “The Wrestlers,” from original antique in the Royal
Gallery, Florence; both reproduced by Barbedienne, Paris.

LEMON HILL MANSION, built by Henry Pratt about 1800, near site of
favorite home of Robert Morris. “The Hills,” planned by Major L’Enfant,
built, 1773; the property was bought by the city in 1844, and dedicated,
in 1855, as a Public Park. Northwest on main drive is GRANT’S CABIN,
headquarters of General U. S. Grant in siege of Richmond, 1864-65,
brought to the Park from City Point, Virginia, at close of Civil War;
opposite is SEDGELEY GUARD HOUSE, formerly the porter’s lodge of the
Sedgeley Park Estate, site of a Gothic mansion, built, 1800, by William
Crammond; acquired for the Park by public-spirited citizens; on same
drive, near east end of Girard Avenue bridge, is the replica bronze
equestrian statue of “JEANNE D’ARC,” sculptor, Fremiet, Paris; among the
best examples of modern French equestrian sculpture. The original is in
“La Place des Pyramids,” Paris.

RIVER DRIVE near boat houses, “Tam O’Shanter,” four figures, red

group, on Richmond granite pedestal, with bronze masks; sculptor, Carl
Steinhauser, Calsruhe, Germany; cast in Philadelphia; near is the
Children’s Playground building, erected by Richard and Sarah Smith in
1898; and a park mansion, MT. PLEASANT, land bought from Phineas Bond by
John MacPherson, who built the house in 1761, after style of a house in
Scotland owned by the chief of his clan, the MacPhersons of Clunie; in
1779, purchased by Benedict Arnold; on his conviction for treason, it
was confiscated by the state; in 1781-82 Baron von Steuben occupied it,
and here wrote the army regulations which created the American Army; in
1868 it became property of the city, and was added to Fairmount Park.

ROCKLAND comes next, on west side of Dairy Ball Field, occupied 1750-65
by John Lawrence, a notable mayor of Philadelphia; near Rockland is

Pennsylvania, named for Scotch home of Mrs. Burd, daughter of Lord
Haliburton of Ormiston, who founded the Burd Orphan Asylum; near Dauphin
Street entrance, Grand Fountain, bronze and iron, and park trolley

in 1693; house built, 1742, by William Coleman, an original member of
the Junto Club; friend of Franklin and Judge of the Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania, colonial, brick; original oak floor is still in fine state
of preservation; boards doweled together; laths are hand-cut, and
handwork on cornices and wainscoting most beautiful; fireplace and
mantel in main room are worthy of attention, although now marred by
paint; later it became the home of the Franks family; EDGELEY ball
field, site of residence built by Philip Syng Physick, 1828-36,
Professor of Surgery at University of Pennsylvania and first American to
be elected member of the Royal Academy of France; the RANDOLPH MANSION
is west of Edgeley; interesting colonial house with beautiful handwork
in cornices.

STRAWBERRY MANSION, near Dauphin Street entrance; residence of William
Lewis; then called Summerville, now used as a restaurant; name was given
when added to the park; fine colonial architecture; main hall shows
still how beautiful it must have been, with exquisite handwork on
cornices, wainscoting, and niches in the hall ornamented with hand
tracery.

Along the river drive we pass other country seats known as Harleigh,
Fairy Hill, and the Laurels, now South, Central, and North Laurel Hill.
Near the Falls on east side of Ridge Road, stood the home of Governor
Thomas Mifflin, the fighting Quaker; from the Falls bridge a fine view
is obtained of the Schuylkill Navy’s race course.

Farther up is the WISSAHICKON Creek, Wisamickan (Catfish Creek), or
Wisaucksickan (yellow colored stream); we enter the deep recesses of
this ravine, where the waters empty into the Schuylkill River;
tradition says that on the northwest bank stood a flour mill; in
Revolutionary times the owner ground glass or plaster, with the wheat,
for the patriot army, for this crime some of Washington’s soldiers
hanged him on a tree in front of his mill; here General Armstrong’s
corps attacked the Hessian and British soldiers, October 4, 1777, while
the Battle of Germantown was in progress: up the Wissahickon drive is
Maple Spring Hotel, decorated by grotesque figures of animals and birds,
carved out of native laurel; beyond this, across the stream, are abrupt
bluffs, from one, the most prominent, called Lover’s Leap, tradition
says, a young Indian and the girl whom he loved, being forbidden to
marry, plunged into the waters below and were drowned; a steep grade
leads to the six-mile stone; here Paper Mill Run empties into the
Wissahickon, and here Nicholas Rittenhouse had his grist mill; just
beyond, close beside an old bridge, is a quaint old house, inside is a
stone tablet marked “C. W. R. 1707,” here DAVID RITTENHOUSE, the famous
astronomer, was born; on Paper Mill Run, the first paper mill in this
country was erected, about 1690, by William Rittenhouse: a portion of
this land near Tulpehocken Street, within park limits, once belonged to
the Queen of Spain; farther is the Blue Stone Bridge, and just beyond is
Lotus Inn.

Northward, the east shore becomes more steep, to Mom Rinker’s Rock, she
is said to have been a witch; upon the height stands a statue of WILLIAM
PENN, with the single word “Toleration” cut on the pedestal; the statue
and land were given to the city, for park purposes, by Hon. John Welsh,
ex-minister to England.

One quarter mile farther is Kitchen Lane, and the HERMIT’S WELL, dug by
Johannes Kelpius, scholar and mystic, who came from Germany with his
followers, forty men, the number of perfection, in 1694, “to the new
world, to see the dawn of the millennium; the pathway to the Light
Illumitable, in the glory of religious liberty in Pennsylvania”; they
were followers of the Essenes who lived in the solitudes of the Dead
Sea, of which St. John the Baptist is said to have been a member; the
Ridge and Valley of the Wissahickon gave them a temple of sacred
grandeur; places there are now known as Hermit’s Land, and Hermit’s
Glen; the piety and humility of Kelpius made him renowned; John Rogers
of Connecticut and leaders of other colonies came long distances to
consult this great Magister, he lived wholly to the service of God and
his fellow men; the Baptistry, a place in the creek, is shown where the
monks immersed their converts; after Kelpius’ death, about 1710, his
followers built the monastery, replaced in 1752 by a stone house, built
by Joseph Gorgas, also called the monastery; ruins still there: the
bones of these faithful men are interred under the floor, in the chancel
of St. Michael’s Protestant Episcopal Church, High Street, Germantown;
also some of their original headstones are there: their books were
given, in 1728, to Christ Church, Philadelphia, where they may still be
seen: the cult is now found about Ephrata, among the Seventh Day
Baptists.

Beyond the monastery, near Livezey’s Lane, are caves, said to have been
the abode of hermits. Half a mile farther is Livezey’s mansion, built,
1698, said to have been neutral ground where British and American
officers met during 1777-78; now headquarters of the Valley Green Canoe
Club; above is Cresheim Creek, a small tributary flowing into the
Wissahickon Creek, among great masses of huge rocks, under tall pines,
making a dark pool, called the Devil’s Pool; said to be bottomless;
scene of an engagement during the Battle of Germantown. Just beyond is
Valley Green, a quaint old wayside inn; here is a stone bridge with
strong buttresses and single arch; the reflection makes a clear oval;
farther is the first drinking fountain erected in Philadelphia, “Pro
Bono Publico,” placed in 1854; white marble; half a mile beyond, at east
end of Rex Avenue Bridge, is Indian Rock, summit crowned by heroic
statue of Tedyuscung, last of Indian chiefs to leave the shores of the
Delaware. Northwest the ravine is deep and the hills steep, winding
toward Chestnut Hill. It is proposed by the city to extend Fairmount
Park, on both sides of the Wissahickon, to Fort Washington, and include
Militia Hill at Whitemarsh, famous in the Revolution, making the Park
one thousand acres larger.

WEST PARK, west end of Girard Avenue Bridge, ZOÖLOGICAL GARDENS, open
daily, including Sundays; in front, bronze group, “The Dying Lioness”;

property owned in America by the Penn family; notable decorations are in
the ground floor room; ceiling, fine example of French stucco, Louis XV
period. The Zoölogical Gardens were incorporated in 1859; oldest
incorporated body of its kind in America; on an area of forty-one acres
arranged by H. Schwarzmann in 1873, opened, 1874, with large and
attractive buildings, in which representative species of living animals
are shown; it is a private organization; the Pathological Laboratory has
for its objects, assistance in the hygienic control of the Garden;
collection of statistics upon diseases of wild animals; and research:
many species of water, and other birds, are on the large lake, and
inclosures scattered through the Garden.

Opposite, on Girard Avenue, is WILLIAM PENN’S HOUSE, originally in
Letitia Street, near Second and Market; first brick house in
Philadelphia, built, 1683, removed in 1883; LANDSDOWNE ENTRANCE to the
Park, under two spacious elliptical arches of the Pennsylvania Railroad
viaduct, carrying the railroad across Girard Avenue, is a dignified and
handsome structure. Near is bronze group, “Hudson Bay Wolves,” sculptor,

In 1732, “The State in Schuylkill,” a fishing club, first social club in
Philadelphia, leased an acre of land near here, and built a hut; annual
rental, three sun perch, presented on a pewter plate; they were here for
ninety years; now in New Jersey; the members espoused the Revolutionary
cause, and in 1774 formed a Company, called “The Light Horse,”

adjacent sunken garden: no other building for similar purposes in this
country can approach it, in dignity of design: contains marble statue
“Il Penseroso,” sculptor, Mosier, acquired, 1874. Notable plants housed
in this building are a gigantic specimen of _Attalea Cohiene_, bay oil
palm, from Central America, possibly most superb palm to be seen under
glass anywhere; _Phœnix Canariensis_ from the Canary Islands;

palms; _Ceroxylon_, wax palms, towering sixty or seventy feet; giant
Rubber trees; _Araucarias_ from Australia; Bamboos from the Orient; and
lofty Tree Ferns from New Zealand unite to produce a wonderfully
impressive scene, not unlike a glorified tropical forest, emphasized by
training creepers up the lofty stems, growing ferns and orchids in
crotches of the limbs, and by the strange aerial roots which reach down
from these clinging plants to seek nourishment in the soil below, as in
the tropical jungle. The Cactus house is arranged to give something the
effect of arid regions, by planting in sterile soil; the Fern houses,
with superb collections of Tree Ferns, and smaller growing _Adiantums_,
_Nephrolepis_, _Acrostichums_, recall the effect of mountain ravines. A
special house is given to the Cycads or Sago palms, survivals of
vegetation of fossil beds, of which this collection is unique in this
country. Another tropical house contains the _Bromeliad_ or pineapple
family, collection unique in many respects.

with communication by boat.

THE SUNKEN GARDEN, west, rearranged to conform to Moorish ideals of
garden approaches, is now a pool, about eight hundred feet long, similar
to that before the Taj Mahal, flanked on both sides by spreading
Oriental planes; beyond this central feature are flower gardens,
following the Oriental in color arrangement, making an effect of noble
proportions. A bronze SUNDIAL shows the variations for each month of the
year, and the time at twelve o’clock in twelve principal cities of the
world; on Tennessee marble pedestal, with four supporting female
figures, emblematic of the four seasons; sculptor, A. Sterling Calder.

plenipotentiary to France from the thirteen provinces, was elected first
president, and continued until his death in 1790. David Rittenhouse,
second president, served until his death in 1796; he, with other
members, successfully observed the Transit of Venus, June 3, 1769,

Philadelphia,” the school was incorporated in 1698, and George Keith
engaged as head master, 1699. In 1701, William Penn, while on a visit to
America, granted the school a charter from his own hand; on the same day
he chartered the city itself. This school is the oldest existing
chartered school in America; a second and more liberal charter was
granted, 1708, and a third charter, under which the school is still
conducted, 1711; the originals of all three of these charters are in the
school’s possession. The school will be moved to Pinehurst, the Waln
estate, twenty-two acres on School Lane near Wissahickon Avenue,

surface having been adapted for the purpose by the Newhall Engineering
Company, Philadelphia, who made there a football oval; an eighteen foot

legislatures might enact; Pennsylvania devoted her share, over $70,000,
to public education, and the controllers erected a high school in
Philadelphia, which was completed, 1838, east side of Juniper Street,
below Market Street. In 1853, the original building was sold; present
structure occupied in 1900. Conferring of academic degrees dates from

diameter of corner columns being increased 1½ inches to overcome
apparent reduction of size from their insulated position; bases 9 feet 3
inches in diameter, 3 feet 2 inches high, capitals 8 feet 6 inches high
and 9 feet 4 inches wide; each shaft, as well as the bases, consists of
a single piece, without vertical joints; at each end of the three story
building is a vestibule, the ceilings of which are supported by eight
columns, whose shafts are composed of a single stone; corner-stone was
laid July 4, 1834, and the completed building transferred to the Board
of Directors, 1847. In the first vestibule is white marble sarcophagus,
with body of Stephen Girard, and his statue by Gevelot; the memorial
room contains portrait of Girard, by J. R. Lambdin, copy from posthumous
portrait by Bass Otis in Masonic Temple; interesting collection of
furniture; pictures; china; silverware, and fine marble bust of Napoleon
I, by Canova, presented to Girard by Joseph Bonaparte.

Present capacity, 1520 boys, admitted from six to ten years of age and
graduated fourteen to sixteen years of age, preference of admission is
given to those born within the old Philadelphia city limits, next in
consideration those born in Pennsylvania, and third group, boys born in
the cities of New York and New Orleans. There are several hundred on
waiting list.

Equipment comprises ten white marble buildings for school and house
purposes, chapel seating 1600, and other buildings, also plant for heat,
light, and power, inclosed on forty acres with a ten-foot high stone
wall. Endowment now about $29,000,000. Soldiers’ and sailors’ monument
on campus, in memory of the graduates who served in the Civil War;

“that the boys might be kept free from denominational controversies.”
Bible has always had a foremost place in the teaching of the college;
Chapel speakers are laymen of prominence in the professional and
business world.

CHESTER COUNTY


Third county formed by William Penn; named for Chester, England. This is
rich agricultural district; its broad well-kept farms, great gray barns,
and comfortable homesteads of stone or brick, many still occupied by
descendants of the original Quaker settlers; together with the gently
rolling surface of the country and its many beautiful streams, all
combine to give the county a character of its own, of quiet pastoral
charm. Both the family names and place names indicate in a general way
the character of the original settlement of the county, Birmingham,
Bradford, Marlborough, and Kennett indicating the settlements of the
English Quakers in the central and southern portion of the county:
Tredyffrin and Berwyn, those of the Welsh in the east; while the Germans

IV

LANCASTER COUNTY


Formed May 10, 1729, by request of the proprietaries, on site of an
Indian village; it was named for Lancashire, England, derived from
Lan-Castra, the Camp at Lan, permanent camp of Roman occupation of
Britain two thousand years ago. Earliest settlers, Swiss Mennonites,
who, in 1710, had warrants for ten thousand acres of land on Pequea
Creek; leader, Bishop Hans Herr; his stone house, built by himself on
this tract, is still standing, with initials and date cut over front
door, “C. H. H. 1719.” A fine Mennonite meeting house, lately built, is
here; on the grounds is huge boulder, marked by the Lancaster County
Historical Society. This is the richest agricultural county in the
United States, of unexampled fertility; the tourist is impressed with
the mammoth barns of this region; luxuriant crops of tobacco are of
special note. The Conestoga River, with its affluents, drains an area of
315 square miles, it is crossed by many bridges. On the border of the
city limits is a nine arch stone bridge, built by Abraham Witmer in
1800, which leads the Lincoln Highway over the Conestoga. At Pequea is
St. John’s Protestant Episcopal Church, according to a quaint old Vestry
Book “Built of wood in 1729, to perform Divine Adoration ... after ye
manner of ye Episcopal Church of England,” the itinerant missionaries of
the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel of England holding
service; cornerstone

making. Joining the Cloister Settlement is Clare Point Stock Farm, now
occupied by the Redemptorist Fathers, a Roman Catholic order, founded in
1732 by St. Alphonsus Maria Leguori, in Italy; of strict discipline and
singleness of purpose, designed to work among neglected country people;
this is their only mission in Pennsylvania.

County seat, LANCASTER, 418 feet above sea, population 53,150; laid out
by Governor Gordon in 1730; near by is the Conestoga River, named by
Conestoga Indians, a tribe of the Delawares; the Dutch who lived here
invented the wagon, with big covered tops, drawn by six horses, and
named it for the river. It is said that here was first given to
Washington the title “Des Landes Vater.” This is a square city, lines
run north and south, east and west, with outlying districts; one,
Rossmere, was named in honor of George Ross, a signer of the Declaration
of Independence.

MANHEIM, laid out by Henry William Steigel, 1762, was named for his
German home town; here he built a large glass factory, first in the
United States; skilled workmen from Europe were employed; a few rare
specimens of this glass, owned by collectors, show fineness of quality,
richness of color, and a peculiar bell-like ring, some specimens are in
the Danner Museum, open Tuesdays, free, to visitors, which outrivals
some, more noted, in the rarity and variety of its collections: in 1772
Steigel gave to the Lutherans at Manheim a piece of ground on which to
build a church; payment to be five shillings and an annual rental of one
red rose; on the second Sunday in June, crowds attend the Baron Steigel
Memorial Church, and at these services a descendant of the Steigels
receives the red rose; the chancel is often filled with red roses
dropped there individually as a tribute; in 1752 Steigel had married a
daughter of John Jacob Huber, who owned a small iron furnace near
Brickerville, he purchased land and became interested in several
furnaces, one he named for his wife, “Elizabeth”; the Elizabeth furnace,
in 1776, came into possession of Robert Coleman of Lebanon, in 1777 it
was overtaxed with large orders of shot and shell for the Continental
Army, and the government sent about two hundred Hessian prisoners, taken
at Trenton, to work there; many remained and became good citizens. Mr.
Coleman’s residence was at Elizabeth furnace, here he entertained
Washington as his guest, who, at his request, sat for a portrait to
Gilbert Stuart, which is now owned by B. Dawson Coleman, Esq.

Lancaster County furnaces in the Conestoga Valley, Caernarvon Township,
were owned by David Jones in 1736; old mines are still there that bear
his name; in 1743 David Branson built the Windsor forges, in the same
township; among his partners was Lynford Lardner, who married his
daughter Rebecca. On the banks of Furnace Run, near Colemanville, may be
seen an old cinder heap, which is all that remains of the Martic
Furnace, built 1751-52 on 3400 acres of land, with the usual houses and
shops; during the Revolution, round iron was drawn under the hammer at
the forge, and bored out for musket barrels; negro slaves were always
employed here; among the past owners of this furnace, from 1777-93, was
a Philadelphia merchant, Michael Hillegas, who became first Continental
treasurer in 1775; in 1777 he was appointed first treasurer of the
United States and continued in that office until 1789.

Near, just below Safe Harbor, in the Susquehanna River, is Indian Rock,
with a number of inscriptions on it, the writing may be seen when water
is low; same writing is found in Beaver County. The bridge over the
Susquehanna River from Columbia to Wrightsville has been replaced
several times, one was burned to stem the tide of the Confederates. At
Elizabethtown are the Masonic Homes of Pennsylvania, on 982 acres, with
Grand Lodge Hall, 437 feet long by 160 feet wide, seventeen dwelling
houses, and other buildings. Georgian architecture, designed by

YORK COUNTY


Formed August 9, 1749; named for the House of York, England. An
agricultural region of great fertility. First authorized settlements
were made in 1733. Before the white settlers came, the territory west of
the Susquehanna River was hunting ground for the Conestoga Indians, a
branch of the Mohawks, who migrated to New York State about 1750; also
for the Susquehannocks and Conewagos, who had their village at present
site of York Haven. When a treaty with the Indians at Albany, in 1736,
gave Penn’s heirs right to the territory from west of the Susquehanna to
the South Mountain, immigrants from Europe flocked into York County, in
vast numbers, and proved a strong and influential part of the
population. During the colonial period four companies of soldiers from
this county assisted in driving the French and Indians from the western
part of the province before 1758.

At beginning of the Revolutionary War it is said that the first military
company from Pennsylvania that arrived at Washington’s headquarters,
siege of Boston, in 1775, shortly after Battle of Bunker Hill, were from
York County; this company, and one commanded by Captain Morgan of
Virginia, were first American troops to use rifles; they became the
terror of the British regulars, who still used the old-time flint
musket. When the British attacked New York City and the Battle of Long
Island followed, Pennsylvania troops camped at Perth Amboy; here two
regiments from York County were formed out of the militia; and became a
part of the Flying Camp, a body of ten thousand men from Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and Maryland, which joined Washington before the Battle of
White Plains; they were also in the battles of Princeton and Trenton.
Colonel Thomas Hartley, a member of York County bar, commanded a brigade
under Washington at battles of Brandywine and Germantown; and after the
Revolution he represented York County in Congress for twelve years; he
was first member of the Pennsylvania bar to be admitted to the Supreme
Court of the United States. President Washington was entertained in his
house in 1791, site marked by tablet.

Shortly before the Battle of Brandywine, September 27, 1777, the
Continental Congress adjourned from Independence Hall to meet in
Lancaster; they were there one day, then crossed the Susquehanna and
made YORKTOWN the seat of government until June 27, 1778, when they
returned to Philadelphia. Twenty-five Congressmen came on horseback over
the old Monocacy Road, and took up quarters in the town and vicinity.
The personnel of Congress was constantly changing; no less than
sixty-four different members were present from first to last. The
mansion, corner of Center Square, where the Colonial Hotel now stands,
had been rented to General Roberdeau; quarters were found there for the
leading Congressmen, Adams, Lee, Harrison, Laurens, and others. John
Adams, in letters to his wife Abigail, complained of his straitened
quarters, and the Dutch cooking. James Smith, a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, gave his law office in Center Square to be
used by the Committee of Foreign Affairs; and the Board of War.

The noted chest of papers, belonging to Congress, which John Adams
declared “was worth more than Congress itself,” was kept by Thomas Paine
at the Cooke’s House, a house of entertainment, still standing, in the
bend of Codorus Creek, then away from town; here he wrote parts five and
six of “The Crisis.” On September 30, 1777, with John Hancock as
President of Congress, the first session was held in the brick court
house, built, 1756; site marked by Yorktown Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution; soon after Congress assembled here, news was
brought of the surrender of Burgoyne to General Gates, with six thousand
British and Hessian troops, at Saratoga. A motion, made by Richard Henry
Lee of Virginia, to set apart a day for Thanksgiving was unanimously
adopted; Thursday, December 18, 1777, was appointed, and a few days
later this historic document was written, and sent by post riders to the
governors of each of the thirteen original states; this was the first
national Thanksgiving proclamation in America, in the sense of its
observation, on the same date, by the thirteen states.

Soon after, General Lafayette arrived in Yorktown and was received in
open session by Congress; the victory of General Gates had made him the
hero of the hour; Washington had been defeated at Brandywine and
Germantown, and gone into winter quarters at Valley Forge; knowing that
a large number of the delegates in Congress at Yorktown favored a plan
to displace him from the head of the army, and promote General Gates to
that position, Washington never visited Congress here; he wrote a
private letter to Robert Morris, saying, “If Congress adjourns, _sine
die_, I wish it understood, I will oppose British invasion, in the
mountains of Pennsylvania and Virginia, rather than give up our cause
for Independence, promulgated July 4, 1776”; this historic letter was
read at an open meeting in Zion Reformed Church.

Congress called General Gates to York, and made him President of the
Board of War; he gave a banquet at his headquarters; among the guests
was Lafayette, twenty-one years of age; speeches were made favoring the
promotion of Gates to position of general in chief of the army, when
Lafayette arose and offered the following toast: “To General George
Washington, head of the American Army; may he continue to hold that
position until a Treaty of Peace is signed with England, acknowledging
the freedom of this country, in whose cause I am listed for its
defense.” It was this incident that caused the collapse of the Conway
Cabal, instigated by General Conway, opponent of Washington and friend
of Gates.

Lafayette visited York in 1825, then sixty-eight years old, and last
surviving Major General of the Revolution; he stopped overnight at
McGrath’s Hotel, on site of the Rupp Building, where a reception and
banquet were given him; among the toasts was, “Lafayette, we love him as
a man, hail him as a deliverer, revere him as a champion of freedom, and
welcome him as a guest”; to which he responded, “The Town of York, the
seat of our American Union in our most gloomy time; may her citizens
enjoy a proportionate share of American prosperity.”

At request of Washington, Baron Steuben came to Yorktown early in 1778,
and was immediately appointed to the rank of major-general; from here he
went to Valley Forge and began to drill and discipline the Army, in the
military tactics used by Frederick the Great. In May, 1778, a nephew of
General Putnam, who crossed the Atlantic in the Mercury, a fast flying
vessel of Congress, which landed at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, brought a
letter to Henry Laurens of South Carolina, President of Congress, from
Benjamin Franklin, saying, “The King of France has resolved to send
$600,000 in silver, an army and a fleet, to aid the Americans in their
struggle for Liberty.” The Articles of Confederation were formed here,
and adopted in Philadelphia the following June. Much Continental money
was ordered by Congress, which was printed in a house, at the corner of
Market and Beaver Streets, marked by tablet.

Penn Park has a soldiers’ monument, to men of York County in Civil War;
this has been the scene of many military gatherings; several
insubordinates of the Pennsylvania line were shot here, by order of
General Wayne, before the forces under him marched to Virginia; and
large hospitals were built here during the Civil War, when York County
was the high-water mark of the Southern Confederacy. On June 28, 1863,
General Jubal Early of Virginia, with 10,000 Confederate troops, took
possession of York. John B. Gordon, leading a brigade of Georgia troops,
was first to enter town; he marched on to Wrightsville with
twenty-eight hundred men, where a skirmish took place, and when the
bridge across the Susquehanna was burned by the Union forces on the
Lancaster County side; Early remained in York two days, with four
brigades, and received word to fall back immediately to Gettysburg. The
first engagement took place in the streets of HANOVER, between
Confederate cavalry under Stuart, who were defeated by Union cavalry
under Kilpatrick; they were prevented from reaching Gettysburg until
evening of second day of battle, which probably turned the tide in favor
of the Union; this event is commemorated in the Center Square by a
statue, that ranks with the best Art in Pennsylvania, a cavalryman,
bronze; sculptor, Cyrus E. Dallim, Boston.

YORK, county seat; population 47,512; is oldest town in Pennsylvania
west of the Susquehanna; the general plan embraced streets forming
perfect squares, with widened space in center of town, junction of
Market and George Streets, for market purposes; these privileges are
still used. Court house in east Market Street, classic; porch with
granite Ionic columns; built, 1903; architect, J. A. Dempwolf; contains
portraits of York County judges; Museum of York County Historical
Society, open every afternoon except Sunday; has large collection of
Indian implements, of war and peace; and etchings by Rosenthal. An
annual art exhibition is held in York. Post Office, classic, Ionic.
Among the many places of worship, several now standing were erected more
than one hundred years ago, including St. John’s Episcopal, in which is
tablet to Colonel Thomas Hartley. In burial ground of First Presbyterian
Church is tomb of James Smith, the signer, who died, 1806; another

[Illustration: CAVALRY STATUE, ERECTED IN 1904, CENTER SQUARE, HANOVER

_Cyrus E. Dellam, Sculptor_]

signer, Philip Livingston, of New York, who died while Congress was in
session here, is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery, where also are the
tombs of General William B. Franklin of the Civil War; his brother Rear
Admiral Samuel R. Franklin; Judge Jeremiah S. Black; and several hundred
Civil War soldiers.

In mentioning the notable men of York, we must include Colonel Hance
Hamilton, first sheriff of York County in 1750; Colonel Richard
McAllister, founder of Hanover, first President Justice of the County
Courts under the Constitution of 1776, and later President of the
Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania; James Ross, born, 1762,
served two terms in the United States Senate, making there an eloquent
speech favoring the Louisiana Purchase, which led to its result; and
Senator Matthew S. Quay, born in Dillsburg, 1833, whose father was
pastor of the Presbyterian Church. Other places marked by tablet are,
site of building of the Franklin Press, where valuable papers were
published during the Revolution, and building of General Anthony Wayne’s
headquarters.

In 1761, the Mary Ann Furnace was built on Furnace Creek; at the same
time a road was cut from there, to connect with the road to the Conewago
settlement leading to Baltimore; the furnace was started by George Ross
of Lancaster, the signer, his brother-in-law, George Stevenson, a lawyer
of York County, and William Thompson, later a general in the Revolution;
and continued for fifty years, under other owners; besides making pig
iron, stoves, and household iron ware, cannon balls and grapeshot were
cast here. The Spring Creek Forge was erected by George Ross, previous
to 1772, and was active many years.

CUMBERLAND COUNTY


Formed January 27, 1750; named for county of Cumberland, England. One of
the two or three rich agricultural valleys in the United States. Early
industries were iron furnaces and forges. First settlers, Scotch-Irish,
men of stout heart and wonderful nerve; almost contemporaneous with
their building forts and providing means of protection for themselves
and families, they established Presbyterian churches, the fine springs
of the valley being selected as sites, namely, Silver Springs Church,
nine miles west of the Susquehanna; Trindle Spring, now a Lutheran
Church; Meeting House Spring, now First Presbyterian Church of Carlisle;
curious old carvings are in Meeting House Springs burial ground; Big
Spring Church, at Newville; and Middle Spring Church, above
Shippensburg, a monument to Revolutionary soldiers is here; all continue
in active existence. The early pioneer countenanced the institution of
slavery, at one period as many as 307 negroes were held as slaves in
this county, the last of them in 1840; on November 1, 1780, an act was
passed, directing that all slaves and those held as such in Pennsylvania
should be registered; but thereafter all should be free men and women.

SHIPPENSBURG, population 4372, first permanent settlement in the county,
founded in 1730, was the only town on the line of the “Great Road” when
it was laid out from John Harris’ Ferry, on the Susquehanna, to the
Potomac, from 1735-44; this road was the first effort to connect the
wilderness west of the Susquehanna with the civilization in the earlier
settlements. First bridge erected in the county was over Letort Spring,
on east Main Street, Carlisle, about 1780, replaced in 1795 by a stone
bridge; several stone arch bridges are over the Yellow Breeches Creek;
at the eastern end is Miller’s Mill bridge, over one hundred years old,
three arch stone, in good condition; Alexander’s bridge is one mile
north of Carlisle on the Conodoguinet Creek, colonial with wooden cover,
one span, is very old.

County seat, CARLISLE, named for shiretown of Cumberland County,
England; population 10,916; the town is laid off at right angles, with a
large public square in center; Bellair Park on the banks of Conodoguinet

[Illustration: DICKINSON COLLEGE, “OLD WEST,” CARLISLE]

THE INDIAN SCHOOL, one mile northeast from Center, was formerly a
military post, buildings were destroyed by Fitz Hugh Lee in 1863,
excepting the old guard house, built by the Hessian prisoners during the
Revolution, in 1777; this was the original “West Point” for the training
of officers and artisans, and for the manufacture of arms and munitions.
In 1776, and throughout the War, anthracite coal was taken down the
Susquehanna River from the Wyoming mines to the armory at Carlisle, said
to have been the first shipment of anthracite coal in this country;
there are now about twenty-five or thirty buildings, brick, of varied
architecture, on twenty-five acres of ground; gateway, Georgian, M. I.
Kast, architect, built, 1910; native Indian art is on exhibition in the
Leupp studio. George Washington joined the army of 15,000 men, as
Commander in Chief, at Carlisle, for suppression of the Whiskey
Insurrection in 1794; he was the guest of Ephraim Blaine; the army was
located on the opposite side of the town from the military post.

The Civic Club of Carlisle is placing classic art prints in the
public-school buildings. Interesting colonial houses: residence of
Ephraim Blaine, built, 1795, now law office and dwelling of Edward
Stiles, built, 1815; of Stephen Duncan, built, 1815, used by the
Fraternity of Owls; and that of Isaac B. Parker, built, 1820, the home
of the Elks.

In 1762, Richard Peters of Philadelphia obtained a patent for 388 acres
of land at Boiling Springs, and executed a deed to John S. Rigby & Co.,
for twenty-nine acres on which they had already commenced the erection
of a blast furnace, they bought two ore banks at the foot of South
Mountain, and soon after added 1614 acres of land, and called the
property “Carlisle Iron Works”; it passed through several ownerships,
until, in 1792, Michael Ege became sole owner; the furnace produced
twelve to fifteen tons of metal a week, mostly pig iron, but they also
cast stoves, fire backs, and hollow ware. William Denning, in 1776, made
two wrought iron cannon in Mount Holly Gap, about six miles south of
Carlisle, the first ever made; one in use at the Battle of Brandywine
was captured by the British and deposited finally in the Tower of
London; the British Government offered a large sum of money and an
annuity to William Denning, to instruct them how to make wrought iron
cannon, but he refused; he died in 1830, age ninety-three, at his home
near Newville, his monument there, given by the state, shows a square
marble base surmounted by a cannon. Pine Grove Furnace was built on
Mountain Creek, halfway between Carlisle and Gettysburg, the recorded
ownership dates from a proprietary grant in 1762 for 450 acres on
Mountain Creek to Thomas Pope; it is now part of the State Forestry
reservation.




VII

NORTHAMPTON COUNTY


Formed March 11, 1752; named by Thomas Penn; prior to the Revolution
comprised all the northeast section of Pennsylvania; chief industries,
Bethlehem Iron and Steel Works, where 15,000 men are employed day and
night; silk mills, graphite works, and other manufactories. Here were
Washington’s storehouses along the Delaware River, with supplies for all
branches of the army; a point of attack by the British battling between
West Point and Trenton, buildings are still in evidence. The famous
backwoods rifles used by two thousand Pennsylvanians against the British
at Boston were made here.

County seat, EASTON, founded by Thomas Penn, 1751; at “The Forks of the
Delaware, where the water is deep and smooth,” population 33,813. In
center of the public square is the monument to soldiers of this county
in the Civil War, on site of the old Northampton court house that stood
for a hundred years; on its threshold was promulgated the Declaration of
Independence, the same day as in Philadelphia; the old court house bell,
that rang out then, is still doing public service. The first flag,
combining stars and stripes, as an emblem of a new nation, was made
here, showing thirteen eight pointed stars and thirteen stripes in the
field, this flag is said to be the one now in the Easton Public Library,
deposited in 1821, after being used in the War of 1812; in a special
room of the

[Illustration: NORTHAMPTON COUNTY]

library is the private collection of Samuel Sitgreaves, with rare
volumes of American history. Next to Sitgreaves’ office was the home and
shop of Henry Derringer, a gunmaker of the Revolution, whose son
invented the Derringer pistol. On the public square, Light Horse Harry
Lee, from Virginia, recruited his troop of Pennsylvania Germans, and
horses. Valuable papers and moneys belonging to the state and national
government were placed in the custody of Robert Levers, during British
occupancy of Philadelphia.

The old Union Church, now the Reformed, on North Third Street, stone,
colonial, built, 1775-76, was used as a hospital in the Revolution; this
is the principal residential street, and entrance to LAFAYETTE COLLEGE,
founded, 1832, by James Madison Porter, Secretary of War; has
interesting collection of portraits of Lafayette, in oil and black and
white, also valuable old engravings; on the campus is statue of
Lafayette, by Daniel Chester French, given by Morris L. Clothier, Esq.
In the New Century Art Club, New and Porter Streets, lectures on art and
exhibitions are given. A bridge leads across the Delaware to
Phillipsburg, New Jersey, first wooden bridge built, 1797; north of the
bridge is Riverside Park, leading to North Delaware Road and the
Delaware Water Gap; the Wind Gap has precipitous sides; very beautiful
scenery is on the River Road.

In July, 1782, Washington came from Bethlehem to Easton. BETHLEHEM, in
Lehigh County, is the seat of government of the Moravian economy, from
Moravia in Bohemia, in the western hemisphere, dating back to 1740;
these pioneers belonged to the Church of the Brethren, organized in
1457 by followers of John Huss about forty years after he had been
burned at the stake for conscience’ sake; the little church was revived
in Saxony in 1722; to this church Count Nicholas L. Zinzendorf granted
an asylum on his own estate; the count visited the Brethren here in
1741. On July 25, 1782, Washington, with Colonel Trumbull and Major
Welker, stayed overnight at the Sun Inn; Brother Ettwein and others of
the Fraternity called to pay their respects; the Sun Inn was built in
1761, Peter Warbas the first host; the suite occupied by General
Washington and his wife is still shown to visitors. During the
Revolution the Moravian settlement experienced many horrors and
discomforts of war; the tramp of armed men through its quiet streets
began in July, 1775; in December most of the houses were taken for
hospitals, being on the main route of travel from the eastern states;
many distinguished soldiers were here, Greene, Knox, Gates, Stirling,
Sullivan, Schuyler, von Steuben, De Kalb, Pulaski, de Chastelleux, also
Samuel and John Adams, Hancock, Laurens, Livingston, Boudinot, Reed,
Rittenhouse, Gerard; in autumn of 1777, Lafayette, under careful nursing
of a Moravian sister, Liesel Beckel, rapidly recovered from a wound
received in the Battle of Brandywine. General hospital of the
Continental Army was here, 1776-78.

The Moravian Church, plain and dignified architecture, after a German
model, is full of sunlight within, contains Moravian archives and
Schussele’s large oil painting, “Power of the Gospel,” showing
Zeisberger preaching to the Indians; the organ and vocal music is
exceptionally fine. The Moravian College and Seminary for young women
includes instruction in housekeeping; moral training is a particular
feature. The Widows’ house, built, 1768, endowed by John Jordan, Jr.,
Philadelphia, for widows and daughters of Moravian ministers and other
women who have served the church. The Sisters’ house, formerly first
Brethren’s house, was used for home of unmarried women of advanced age;
now a boarding house. Second Brothers’ house, where unmarried men could
live and still gain independent support, is now “Colonial Hall,” a part
of the Seminary. Corpse house still stands with its weeping willow tree;
because of the small rooms of the houses, the body was taken from the
home to the corpse house for three days; the trombone choir announced a
death from the church steeple by a particular choral that designated
whether it was for man, woman, or child; at the burial the trombone
choir met the procession at the cemetery gate and took part in the
service at the grave; in the Moravian burial ground are graves of many
Indians, among them that of Uncas, in Cooper’s “Last of the Mohicans,”
inscription, “In memory of Tschoop, a Mohican Indian, who, in holy
baptism, April 16th, 1742, received the name of John, one of the first
fruits of the mission at Wycomico, whereby he became a distinguished
teacher among his nation. He departed this life in full assurance of
faith at Bethlehem, August 27, 1746.” The graves are in rows, sisters
and brothers separate, with small stone markers. Bethlehem had the
second waterworks system in the United States, 1760.

A covered wooden bridge over one hundred years old, to be replaced by
modern structure, crosses the Lehigh River to SOUTH BETHLEHEM,
Northampton County, seat of Lehigh University, built, 1866; in 1865, Asa
Packer gave $500,000 for founding a free technical college for boys in
South Bethlehem, largest single benefaction any American college had
received up to this time; this was the beginning of Lehigh University,
opened the following year; later a classical department was opened at
Mr. Packer’s direction, who gave the University $1,500,000 during his
life, and left it by will another $1,500,000, to ease the struggle
upwards of boys with whose ambitions he sympathized; this University is
particularly noted for its course in engineering, with the Fritz
Engineering Laboratory, endowed with over $1,000,000; there are also a
gymnasium with swimming pool, and a stadium.

The BACH FESTIVAL, announced by the trombone players from the tower of
Lehigh University Chapel, has been held annually since 1911, first
performance was in 1888. In 1780, the settlement had an orchestra, said
to be the first in America, flutes, horns, viols, and trombones were
permanent factors in their church music, which undoubtedly led up to the
present development; frequently referred to as the American Bayreuth; a
quartet of trombones summoning the people, as do the trumpets in
Germany; in 1901, the Christmas Oratorio was given in its entirety,
first in America; they have also given the Passion, and the Mass in B
Minor; J. Frederick Wolle, pupil of Rheinberger, organist of the
Lutheran Church, has charge of the music; choir consists of 200 voices,
natives of Bethlehem, excepting leading soloists; the orchestra and
instrumental soloists vary, the Philadelphia Orchestra has played here.
Location of Bethlehem is scenically quite as beautiful as Eisenach in
the Thuringian forest, where the famous Wartburg, with memories of
Tannhaeuser, Bach, and Luther attract thousands of tourists and
pilgrims. In NAZARETH are old stockaded forts of the Indian wars, where
were maintained 365 settlers from beyond the mountains, now used by the
Moravian Historical Society for their collection of relics, curios, and
portraits of noted Indians. Whitfield house, built, 1755, old English,
contains Moravian Historical Collection; Nazareth Hall, built, 1748, was
school for young men. At Boulton, near Nazareth, is Benjamin West’s
first tragic painting, “Death of Socrates.”

BERKS COUNTY


Formed March 11, 1752; reduced to present limits, 1811; named for
Berkshire, England, where Penn family had large estates; has broad,
fertile plains and valleys, intermingled with rough hills and mountains
containing mineral wealth in iron. First settlers were Germans, and
Friends from England, 1704-12, among whom was George Boone, ancestor of
Daniel Boone of Kentucky, who was born here, in Exeter Township, 1735.
Mordecai Lincoln, great-great-grandfather of Abraham Lincoln, also lived
in Exeter Township; he owned one thousand acres of land, had interest in
iron forges; and built a small stone house in 1733, that now forms one
end of the present homestead, which remained in the Lincoln family until
1912; the Lincoln men of Berks County were all men of note, several
holding public positions; one, Abraham, married Anna Boone; he died,
1806.

In 1729, Conrad Weiser came over with Germans from the Palatinate and
settled near Womelsdorf, where he is buried in the family burial ground;
marked by boulder; his granddaughter was married to the “Patriarch”
Henry Melchoir Muhlenberg; farm and burial ground of Conrad Weiser,
purchased by the Burks County Historical Society, is to be maintained as
a Memorial Park. The Dutch came in 1730; their descendants still reside
on their ancestral estates; they named the river, flowing through the
county, Schuylkill (hidden creek); Indian name was Manai-unk. When war
was declared between England and France, the French found the Indians
eager to join them against the British, and after Braddock’s defeat at
Fort Duquesne in 1755, they devastated these peaceful settlers, by fire
and slaughter, until 1778, when they were driven beyond the Alleghenies.
This region has become famous for wine making; vines are grown on Mount
Penn, Neversink, and the Alsace Mountain slopes; over fifty years ago,
George L. Reiniger left the fertile vineyards of Wurtemberg and settled
here, where the soil, scenery, and environment seemed so much like the
fatherland; these vineyards are now used for the cultivation of dahlias.

READING, county seat; population 107,784; was laid out in 1748 by agents
of Richard and Thomas Penn; named for Reading, in Berkshire, England.
Courthouse on Penn Common, Fifth and Penn Streets, built, 1762; present
building in 1840, on north Sixth Street; colonial with Ionic porch;
cupola eighty-four feet above the roof. In the park are equestrian

of Fifth Street and Penn Square, was built in 1764 for a tavern;
Washington stayed here in

[Illustration: THE JAIL AT READING

_John C. Haviland, Architect_]

1794, en route to join troops against the Whiskey Rebellion; now
Farmers’ Bank; it is marked as the oldest building in town. The Hessian
camp ground, southwest of Reading, is also marked.

Trinity Church, most important Lutheran Church in this country, is a
fine example of Georgian architecture, northwest corner of Sixth and
Washington Streets; was built, 1791. Christ Protestant Episcopal
Cathedral, Gothic, brownstone; built in 1864; architect, Potter, New
York; has good windows. The Reading Museum and Art Gallery, Eighth and
Washington Streets, has a good collection of paintings, representing
foreign and American artists, including sixty paintings given by Mrs.
William Littleton Savage, as memorial to her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
George DeBenneville Keim, and other works of art and natural history; it
is open free to the public. The Historical Society of Berks County, 38
North Fourth Street, has a good historical collection. Among the notable
artists who have lived in Reading are Christopher H. Shearer,
represented in permanent collection at Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts, Philadelphia; Benjamin F. Austrian, noted still-life painter, born
here, 1870; James A. Benade, landscape; F. D. Devlan, animal painter and
cartoonist; during the Civil War he furnished many cartoons for Frank
Leslie’s illustrated newspaper; George Seiling, mural decorator, born in
Bavaria, 1818, his paintings are in St. James’ Church, “The
Transfiguration,” and Calvary Church, “Christ Bearing the Cross.”
Calvary Reformed Church has stone mosaic decoration in chancel by H.
Hanley Parker.

Charles Evans Cemetery, acquired by gift in 1864, has Gothic gateway,
dark sandstone; made in 1847; architects, Calver & Hall, Philadelphia;
the chapel is brownstone, Gothic, built, 1854; architect, John M. Gries,
who was a major in the Union Army, killed in battle of “Fair Oaks”; here
is the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, with bronze tablets; erected,
1889.

Reading was the resort of many fugitives families from Philadelphia
while British were there in the winter of 1776-77, and became the scene
of much gayety. General Mifflin, afterwards governor, had his country
seat at Cumru, three miles southeast of Reading, now used as the County
Almshouse and Hospital buildings. In the different wars of this country
Berks County men were among the first to offer their services; the
Ringgold Light Artillery, Captain James McKnight, is said to have been
the first company that reported at Harrisburg in response to President
Lincoln’s Proclamation in 1861, and was one of five Pennsylvania
companies to arrive first at Washington in defense of the Capital.

At KUTZTOWN, settled by Germans in 1733, is the Keystone State Normal
School, originally MAXATAWNY Seminary, but since 1866, the Normal
School, enlarged after most improved models of school architecture. Four
miles distant is VIRGINSVILLE; here is a natural curiosity, the “Crystal
Cave,” of vast dimensions, with crystal formations in every shape and
color; it is lighted by electricity. BOYERTOWN, with two large
academies, and BIRDSBORO, with fine churches and residences, are noted
for their iron furnaces. HAMBURG is the home of the Berks County State
Sanatorium No. 3 for tuberculosis; Spanish architecture. Berks County
has several picturesque old bridges, the oldest, with one arch, stone,
built in 1822, spans the Wyomissing Creek at its mouth, opposite
Reading. Thirteen other stone arch bridges, the longest, over Maiden
Creek, four arches, built in 1854; and twenty-five wooden covered
bridges, are decided artistic assets.

Historic iron furnaces in Berks County are at BIRDSBORO, Hay Creek
Forges, built, 1740, by William Bird on land obtained by warrant and
survey; he also erected Hopewell Furnace in 1759, and the Berkshire
Furnace in Heidelberg about 1760; his son, Mark Bird, inherited the
property, and built Spring Forge and Gibraltar Forge; in 1796, John
Louis Barde became the owner; his daughter was married to Matthew
Brooke, who subsequently purchased the property, which has become an
extensive iron works. COLEBROOKDALE, famous as the seat of the first
blast furnace in Pennsylvania, was on Iron Stone Creek, named for the
Colebrookdale furnace, in Shropshire, England; it was founded by Thomas
Rutter and Thomas Potts in 1720: in 1724, the output was forty-eight
tons of pig iron per annum, each ton valued at £5; this was the first
furnace to cast pots, kettles, and other hollow ware by the use of sand
moulds; it had a long and prosperous career. HOPEWELL, a cold blast, one
stack furnace, employed one hundred and seventy men and boys, the iron
ore was obtained from the Hopewell mine, about two miles away, water
from Hopewell Creek formed the motive power; a dam was constructed a
quarter of a mile above the furnace and conveyed by a race to the big
water wheel; the property covered 5163 acres, chiefly woodland; stoves
were cast here with much detailed design, marked with the name of Bird;
also cannon for the Revolutionary Army; Hopewell furnace, although idle
for many years, is not dismantled, and the village street of
iron-workers’ homes is much the same as it must have been in early
times.

OLEY FORGE, south of the little hamlet called Oley Churches, and about
ten miles from the confluence of the Manatawny and Schuylkill rivers,
was organized by John Ross in 1744, and was in active operation for one
hundred and twenty years. In 1760, a valuable deposit of iron ore was
found in Oley Township, and in 1765 Dietrich Welcker erected OLEY
FURNACE, near the mountain; it was owned by General Daniel Udree during
the Revolution. PINE FORGE was among the earliest of those erected in
the Manatawny district, on land conveyed by William Penn to Thomas
Rutter; the original patent is in possession of the Rutter family. There
is every evidence that the group of early forges and furnaces had a
general interchange in their business affairs, as the owners of the
plants were almost identical; William Bird, in 1733, was cutting wood
for the use of Pine Forge, at two shillings ninepence a day. Ten years
later we find him renting one-eighth of Pine Forge at £40 per annum.

The management of the old forges was patriarchal in its character; grist
mill, sawmill, and the village store were all under control of the
company, and the records of the old forges and furnaces are filled with
human interests of an earlier day. WINDSOR FURNACE,

[Illustration: TRINITY CHURCH, READING, BUILT IN 1791]

on Furnace Creek, under shadow of the Blue Mountains, besides making pig
iron and the usual hollow ware cast in colonial times, was noted for
remarkable artistic work under the management of Jones, Keim & Co.; one
casting, being a copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” is now in
possession of the Philadelphia Exchange.

BEDFORD COUNTY


Formed March 9, 1771; named by Governor John Penn, in 1776, from fort of
this name in the county. Is widely known for its mineral springs. When
first established it embraced entire southwest part of the province.
Mean altitude 1100-1200 feet above sea level; in northwest at Blue Knob,
near Blair and Cambria County line, is highest elevation in
Pennsylvania, 3136 feet above sea level. Surface is broken by parallel
ranges of mountains, with narrow, beautiful valleys, in a high state of
cultivation. Chief industries are farming, stock raising, and apple
growing. It is said that the most important fields of bituminous coal in
Pennsylvania are largely in the northeast of this County known as “The
Broad Top Coal Fields.” Population Scotch-Irish, German, and English.

First permanent settlement was made in 1750, by a Scotchman named Ray
(McRay), an Indian trader, near present site of Bedford, then Raystown.
In 1755, Colonel James Burd was appointed by the province to construct
the first wagon road, from Fort Louden, Franklin County, to join
Braddock’s road near Turkey Foot, Somerset County, passing through
Raystown (Bedford), practically identical with the Chambersburg and
Bedford Turnpike, now Lincoln Highway. On western border where this road
crosses main range of the Alleghenies, at a point two-thirds of the
ascent, is a view unsurpassed in the picturesque charm of the
landscape, stretching far and wide. The highway follows the main course
of the Raystown Branch of the Juniata, crossing this stream at least
four times; bridges are iron or old wooden ones.

The fort at Raystown was constructed in 1758 by the vanguard of General
Forbes’ army; it embraced about seven thousand square yards, occupying
the bluff now bounded on the east by Richard Street; south, Pitt Street
(Lincoln Highway); west, Juliana Street; north, the Raystone River; it
was the most prominent military stronghold in the central part of the
province, and the principal rendezvous of troops forming the right wing
of General John Forbes’ army in his expedition against Fort Duquesne,
5850 men, besides wagoners; largest single contingent was 2700
Pennsylvania provincials under Colonel Bouquet, who had chief charge of
entire force, until General Forbes arrived; the 1600 Virginians were
under command of Colonel George Washington and Colonel William Byrd. In
1759, General John Stanwix, then in command of the garrison, had the
name changed to Fort Bedford, in honor of the Duke of Bedford; now no
trace of the fortification remains.

In 1794, Bedford became the headquarters of General Henry Lee, Governor
of Virginia, who was commander in chief of the army of 13,000 troops
raised to quell the Whiskey Insurrection; President Washington, after
reviewing the troops at Carlisle and Cumberland, came to Bedford and
made his headquarters in a stone house on Pitt Street, house still
standing.

BEDFORD, county seat, population 2330; laid out, 1766, by Surveyor
General John Lukens, with a commodious square, in the most convenient
place. Courthouse erected, 1828, colonial with clock tower, architect
and contractor, Solomon Filler, faces the square. Opposite is the United
States Post Office, built, 1915, Indiana limestone, classic, Doric
columns, architect, Oscar Wenderoth; also facing the square are the
Presbyterian Church, colonial, built, 1828, on site of an earlier one
built in 1810; and the Lutheran Church, fine two-story building and
parsonage. The Soldiers’ Monument in honor of Bedford County volunteers
in Civil War occupies center of square. Handsome memorial colonial
gateway forms entrance to Bedford Cemetery, stone, with bronze tablets.

The therapeutic qualities of the Mineral Springs are believed to be
second to none anywhere in the world, and justly entitle Bedford to the
name of the Carlsbad of America; one and one-half miles south of the
borough, within an area of a few square rods, several varieties of water
are to be found; most famous is the Magnesia Spring, efficacious in
disturbances of the digestive organs; others are known as the Black
Sulphur, Limestone, Chalybeate, and Sweet Water Spring. Colonial Hotel
has a colonnade of Doric columns, twenty feet high, made of native solid
trees; the links for the Scottish game of golf are on a place earlier
named Caledonia. The Bedford Chalybeate Springs, about one mile
northeast of the town, contain waters showing analysis of carbonate of
calcium, magnesium, iron and sodium, and sulphite of calcium. Ten miles
southwest of Bedford are the White Sulphur Springs in Milliken’s Cave,
second largest health resort in the country; waters are unexcelled in
health-restoring properties.

[Illustration: NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY]

NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY


Formed March 21, 1772; named for the Duke of Northumberland.
Mountainous, with great amount of fertile land, watered by the
Susquehanna River and tributaries. Chief industry is coal mining.

County seat, SUNBURY, population 15,721, on site of a populous Indian
village named Shamokin, occupied variously by different tribes; in 1745,
the town contained about fifty houses and three hundred inhabitants; the
Six Nations used it as a tarrying place for their war parties against
the Catawbas of the South.

It was the residence of Shikellimy, an Oneida chief sent by the
Iroquois, who claimed the land by conquest in 1728, he was the Indian
diplomat, and land agent of the three great tribes of Pennsylvania, New
York and Delaware, with supervision of the Delaware, Shawnee, and other
tribes. He also had to look after all matters relating to the settlement
and purchase of Indian lands by the whites. In 1742, Count Zinzendorf,
with Conrad Weiser and others, came to Shamokin; Shikellimy gave them a
hearty welcome, and promised to forward their design of having a
Moravian Mission there; it was established in 1747 by Martin Mack and
his wife; Bishop Cammerhoff and Zeisberger visited the town the next
year. In 1748 Shikellimy died; “the Chief who never swerved in his
friendship to the Province”; he had been baptized in the Christian faith
in Bethlehem, and was buried just outside of what was later Fort
Augusta; James Logan, his second son, was perhaps the best known of his
children; made so by the murder of his family, near the mouth of Yellow
Creek, on the Ohio, in 1774, and the famous “Logan’s Lament.” A large
boulder, with memorial tablet, marks Shikellimy’s grave; it was placed,
in 1915, by the Fort Augusta Chapter, Daughters of the American
Revolution, and the Pennsylvania Historical Commission; the boulder is
of very close grained rock, of the kind used by the Indians for their
hardest and strongest implements; it was quarried near Wapwallopen,
about forty miles above Sunbury; this rock boulder, from our local
mountains, will resist the forces of nature for centuries to come, as it
has done for ages past.

Shamokin (Sunbury) was also the residence of Allummapees, or Sassounan,
the head chief of the Delawares, so that this place was, in every sense
of the term, the Indian capital of Pennsylvania from 1728-48, and was
deserted in 1749 on account of a severe famine along the Susquehanna. At
the north of Sunbury, along the river drive, is site of Fort Augusta,
built in 1756 by Colonel Miles and Captain Trump of the Second
Pennsylvania Battalion; it was the frontier, after Forts Muncy, Brady,
and Freeland were destroyed in 1779 by British and Indians; the powder
magazine, and well, built of brick, are still intact and in good
preservation. This was said to have been the most strategic point in the
whole section; a monument on either side of the roadway marks the place.
On the site of the fortifications is a brick mansion; within are many
relics taken from the fort, and draft of original plan. Visitors are
welcome. Site of Fort Freeland on north side of Warrior’s Run, four
miles east of Watsontown; it was a large stockaded log house, built in
1773, enclosing about half an acre.

SUNBURY was laid out 1772, by William Maclay and John Lukens, by order
of Governor Richard Penn, who named it. William Maclay, first United
States Senator from Pennsylvania, built his stone residence, still
standing, on the river bank in northwest part of town; the city plan is
like that of Philadelphia, and many of the streets have the Philadelphia
names; Market Street faces a public square between Second and Third
Streets, known as Cameron Park, in which is the Civil War Soldiers’
Monument, granite shaft surmounted by a life-size, granite statue of
Colonel James Cameron, who organized a regiment from this county.
Courthouse, Second Street, facing west side of Cameron Park, originally
built in 1866; Georgian; brick with Hummelstown brownstone trimmings;
was remodeled in the same style in 1915 and enlarged, in the rear, with
a cross wing, giving two fine courtrooms, last architect, William H.
Lee, Shamokin. The prison, one block away, at the corner of Second and
Arch Streets, medieval castle style, built, 1878, dark gray stone, with
stone wall twenty feet high, surrounding the whole structure, has wing
used as a penitentiary, where prisoners serve out their sentences; they
weave carpets and make coarse hosiery.

NORTHUMBERLAND, settled, 1772, population 4061. Dr. Joseph Priestly,
chemist and philosopher, was its most noted inhabitant; he emigrated
here in 1794, to be with his son, and died, 1804; in 1874, Scientists
of America celebrated here the centennial of Dr. Priestly’s discovery of
oxygen; his house, built, 1796, is still standing, in excellent
preservation; a portrait of Dr. Priestly, by Gilbert Stuart, is owned by
Miss Priestly. The Academy was erected in 1803, mainly through the
efforts of Dr. Priestly; Rev. Isaac Greer, first principal.




XI

WESTMORELAND COUNTY


Formed February 26, 1773, named for the County of Westmoreland, England.
Chief industries, coal, coke, gas, and manufactories. Ruins of old
furnaces abound in this section, relics of the iron industry about 1800.
The Lincoln Highway crosses this county, formerly the Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh Turnpike, entering near LAUGHLINSTOWN, at the base of Laurel
Ridge, elevation, 2700 feet; here is a museum of relics, shown in an old
tavern of stage coach days, built about 1800, where Daniel Webster is
said to have stopped, and Zachary Taylor, in 1848, held a reception.
Three miles west is LIGONIER, on site of a fort built by Captain Burd
under the direction of Colonel Bouquet, a Swiss; named for Sir John
Ligonier, a famous English general; all traces of the fort have been
obliterated; a descriptive tablet, erected by the Daughters of the
American Revolution, is in the town square. In the High School Library
is an engraving, from a painting by Sir Joshua Reynolds, of Sir John
Ligonier. Near by is Idlewild Park.

At Bushy Run the Indians made a furious attack on Bouquet and his
company but were utterly routed and they retreated beyond the Ohio;
Bouquet then marched to Fort Pitt and recovered it in 1763; next year he
led an expedition beyond the Ohio River, the Indians sued for peace, and
he compelled them to

[Illustration: WESTMORELAND COUNTY]

bring all their captives to Fort Pitt. One and a half miles west of
Ligonier is residence of General Arthur St. Clair, from 1767-72, “The
Hermitage,” rebuilt, excepting one room, which is well cared for; there
is a well-grounded tradition that Washington sent from Mount Vernon two
expert carpenters, whose quaintly designed woodwork, mantelpiece and
wainscoting doubtless saved this room from destruction; the house was
marked in 1913, by the Phœbe Bayard Chapter, Daughters of the American
Revolution, of Greensburg.

Four miles west of Latrobe is St. Vincent’s Monastery and Church,
dedicated in 1905, brick and stone buildings, with highly decorated
interiors, containing the main altar, onyx, set with jewels, and fine
wood carvings from Italy. North, on William Penn Highway, is NEW
ALEXANDRIA; here, owned by Elizabeth Craig, is a Rattlesnake Flag, in
use before the Revolution, made of crimson silk; in the upper left-hand
corner is the English coat of arms; on the field is a rattlesnake with
thirteen rattles, indicating the thirteen colonies; underneath are the
words “Don’t tread on me,” J. P. F. B. W. C. P.--for John Proctor’s
First Battalion Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania; by whom it was
adopted.

GREENSBURG, population 15,033, formerly called Newtown, settled in 1782;
made county seat in 1786, and name changed in honor of General Nathaniel
Greene, who had died at Savannah, Georgia, that same year; many of the
Westmoreland County soldiers served under him in the Revolution. It now
has its fourth courthouse, a dignified building, French Renaissance,
white granite, the façade surmounted by a well-proportioned dome,
dedicated, 1908; architect, William Kauffman; contains portraits of
judges and lawyers. Among the churches of good architecture are the
United Brethren, classic, Doric, architects, Winkler & Macdonald; and
the First Presbyterian on South Main Street, Gothic, stone, architects,
Cram & Ferguson. Other notable buildings are the Post Office, classic,
Ionic; the Y. M. C. A., an adaptation of Colonial, and St. Joseph’s
Academy, with beautiful grounds, overlooking the whole town.

In St. Clair Cemetery is a monument to General Arthur St. Clair, who is
buried here. About five miles distant is Oakford Park. Fells Church in
Rostravor Township southwest is said to be the second Methodist Church
west of the Alleghenies, built of logs in 1792; present stone building
in 1834; in the burial ground are many pioneers of western
Pennsylvania.




XII

WASHINGTON COUNTY


Formed March 28, 1781; named for President Washington; originally part
of Augusta County, Virginia. First court held here was two miles west on
the Gabby farm, marked by granite block; inscription, “On this spot, was
held in 1776, the County Court, for the District of West Augusta,
Virginia; the first Court held by English-speaking people, west of the
Monongahela River. Erected by Washington County Historical Society
1905.” Chief industries, between 1860-80 raising fine stock and wool
growing; in 1884, oil was discovered and for ten or fifteen years this
county became an oil center, with some of the largest wells; now coal is
being shipped all over the country from seemingly boundless veins.

WASHINGTON, county seat, laid out in 1782, population 21,480.
Courthouse, built in 1900, on Main Street, Italian Renaissance, Columbia
sandstone and granite; architect, F. J. Osterling; contains portraits,

where the town now is. Town Hall, corner-stone laid by General U. S.
Grant, in 1869; contains Public Library, gift of Dr. Francis J. Le
Moyne. Washington and Jefferson College, combined in 1870, from
Washington College founded 1787, and Jefferson College founded in
Canonsburg, 1802; both flourished until the Civil

[Illustration: WASHINGTON COUNTY]

War, when many students enlisted and financial depression followed;
located one square east of the courthouse; oldest part, two story,
stone, erected, 1793; main building, brick, 1836, enlarged, 1875, houses
the Y. M. C. A., the museum, classrooms, and laboratories; several other
fine buildings of brick and stone are on the campus; chapel contains

institutions for women students, one square south of college, was built,
1836. Bradford House, first stone house in this locality, was built,
1794, by Colonel William Bradford, a leader in the Whiskey Insurrection.
Residence, Dr. Francis Julius Le Moyne, native of this town, built in
1812, East Maiden Street near Main, is one of the landmarks; he was a
brilliant scholar, abolitionist, and promoter of the underground
railroad; he built the first crematory in America, located south of
Washington, first cremation, Baron de Palen, in 1876. Dr. Le Moyne was
cremated, 1879. The Presbyterian Church leads, with the other principal
denominations represented, also Jewish Synagogue. West from Washington,
the Campbell family founded the Disciples, or Christian Church, on
Buffalo Creek.

The Cumberland Road, built, 1811, brought an almost unbroken stream of
home seekers through this town, en route to the west; bridges and
culverts built about the same time still stand, models of solid masonry
and good engineering, one is between Washington and Claysville, town
named for Henry Clay, who had an interest in the road and frequently
came here.

CANONSBURG, laid out, 1787, by Colonel John Canon, population 10,632, a
portion of his first grist mill is on original location near Chartier’s
Creek. Jefferson College chartered, 1802; oldest building erected in
1830; on North Central Avenue, highest ground in town; was outgrowth of
Dr. John McMillan’s Log Cabin Latin School from 1782; first classical
school west of the Allegheny Mountains, his cabin stands on the campus,
marked by a bronze tablet, placed by the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity,
custodians; having been removed from its original site, two miles south
of town; Franklin Hall, converted into a Memorial Hall in 1900, contains
portraits of college presidents and professors between 1802-69, also
collections of old books from several early libraries and literary
societies; may be seen by applying to any of the Memorial Hall
Committee. Stone edifice, opposite campus, built by John Roberts, Esq,
who conducted a school and kept post office here in 1801, parts of walls
are said to be part of stone Academy Building, erected by Colonel Canon,
for which he donated the ground in 1790; it was merged with the Log
Cabin School to form Jefferson College.

Two-story building at northeast corner of Central Avenue and Pike
Street, now grocery and hardware store, was site of the Joshua Emery’s
Hotel; here President James Monroe was entertained in 1817. On east side
of North Central Avenue, between Pike and College Streets, vacant lot,
site of Black Horse Tavern, notable as the resort of men who rifled the
mail sacks, when letters supposed to contain evidence against violaters
of the excise laws were stolen, _en route_ to Philadelphia from
Pittsburgh, 1794. Residence 62-68 East Pike Street, built by Dr.
Jonathan Letherman, before 1830, here Dr. John McMillan died in 1833;
the flower garden, with brick wall, was laid out by a landscape gardener
brought from Philadelphia by Dr. Letherman, original designs still
retained. The Hutchinson house, north side, West College Street, corner
of Hutchinson Avenue and adjacent lots, once the Hutchinson farm, was
where the “Whiskey boys” encamped in 1794, here also “musters” were held
before the Civil War. Chartiers Presbyterian (Hill) Church and burial
ground, one mile south of Canonsburg, is where Dr. John McMillan began
his pastorate in 1775, and was buried; here, Woodrow Wilson’s father was
also a former pastor; this site became a rendezvous for the Whiskey
Insurrectionists in 1794.

A natural park of seventy acres, within east side of the borough,
acquired by gift, is a beautiful breathing spot for the whole community.
About one mile northeast of Canonsburg, at Morganza, is the Western
Pennsylvania Industrial School; the Morgan Lands, eleven hundred acres,
was the home of General George Morgan, Indian agent in Pittsburgh
1775-79; a portion of his residence is still standing, about midway
between Morganza and Pollock; here he was visited by Aaron Burr in 1806.
General Morgan and his two sons were summoned to Richmond, as witnesses,
when Burr was tried for treason.

MONONGAHELA, an important town, first called Parkinson’s Ferry, then
Williamsport; the men here took an active part in the Whiskey
Insurrection, 1794. It furnished its quota of soldiers, known as the
Williamsport Rangers, for the War of 1812. Monument to Colonel Hawkins,
and to the Philippine veterans. James Gillespie Blaine was born at West
Brownsville in 1830. AMITY, southern part of Washington, near county
line, was the residence of Solomon Spalding, born in Connecticut,
minister of the Congregational Church; here he wrote the “Manuscript
Found,” or Book of Mormon; he was not a robust man, and spent many hours
writing this romance, with no idea of founding a religious sect; he
would read his book in the evenings to the men gathered in the general
store; died, 1816, age fifty-five, grave marked by large granite block.




XIII

FAYETTE COUNTY


Organized September 26, 1783; named in honor of the Marquis de
Lafayette; occupied prominent place in Indian, Revolutionary, and later
wars. On Jacobs Creek, a mile and a half above the point where it
empties into the Youghiogheny River, stands the ruins of the first
furnace for the production of pig iron, west of the Allegheny Mountains;
the furnace was put in blast November, 1790, and was known as the
Alliance Iron Works, operated by William Turnbull and Peter Marmie of
Philadelphia; it continued in blast until 1802 using the native ores
from the neighboring hillsides, and charcoal burned from the surrounding
forests; in 1792 the company cast four hundred six-pound shot for the
Fort Pitt Arsenal at Pittsburgh. Coal mining and coke are now the chief
industries. Connellsville coke is known throughout the industrial world.

Aboriginal inhabitants were the Shawnee Indians, who made various
earthworks and burial mounds, along the Monongahela and Youghiogheny
Rivers before their migration southward; it was part of the “Hunting
Grounds” of the Iroquois Confederation; the “Indian Title” was
extinguished by treaty at Fort Stanwix, 1768.

In 1749 Nemacolin, a Delaware Indian, guided Colonel Thomas Cresap from
Wills Creek, Cumberland, Maryland, to the mouth of Dunlap’s Creek,
where

[Illustration: FAYETTE COUNTY]

Fort Burd was erected in 1759, on site of “Redstone Old Fort,” an Indian
earthwork, now Brownsville; this was called Nemacolin’s trail, and was
the best course for the Ohio Company to reach the Ohio River. It was
followed by Washington, with Christopher Gist, to the French forts in
1753, the first actual step here, in conflict with France. During the
“French and Indian War” Fayette County was the scene of some of the most
thrilling events in American history. In 1745 Washington’s expedition to
gain possession of the Ohio Valley followed this trail to drive the
French from “The Forks” (Pittsburgh); he advanced to Gist’s Plantation
at Mount Braddock, then retreated to The Great Meadows, Fort Necessity,
marked by tablet at Mount Washington, where he was defeated by the
French under M. Coulon de Villers; previous to this, Washington had met
a detachment of French soldiers under M. Coulon de Jumonville, in which
Jumonville was killed, grave marked by tablet; first blood shed in
French and Indian War.

In 1755 Major General Edward Braddock’s expedition against Fort Duquesne
followed Nemacolin’s trail to Mount Braddock, thence over Catawba trail,
which enters Fayette County at mouth of Dunkards Creek; northward
through Uniontown, crossing the Youghiogheny (Stewarts Crossing) at
Connellsville, on through Mount Pleasant to Westmoreland County,
Hunkers, Circleville, to McKeesport; crossing the Monongahela, then
recrossing below at mouth of Turtle Creek. General Braddock, mortally
wounded in the battle of the Monongahela, was carried back over the road
he had opened to a point on the Cumberland Road, National Pike, where
he died and was buried; Washington read the Episcopal burial service
over him; grave marked by monument, erected by officers of his old
regiment, the “Coldstream Guards of England.” Braddock’s Road became the
main highway for settlers of Southwest Pennsylvania and Kentucky; the
entire course is full of historic interest; sites of encampments,
blockhouses and Indian forts; some are marked.

UNIONTOWN, county seat, formed, 1776; population 15,692. Courthouse,
Italian Renaissance; stone; architects, E. M. Butz and William Kauffman,
Pittsburgh. Presbyterian Church has fine Tiffany windows. Mr. James
Hadden, the historian of Fayette County, has a life-size bust of
Washington, cut by himself from the wood of a wild cherry tree, which
grew within the lines of Fort Necessity, in 1784. Washington owned the
land on which the tree stood. Two miles south is Fort Gaddis, only
frontier or settlers’ fort now standing in Fayette County, marked by
tablet in 1908; there were sixteen such forts in this county, built of
heavy logs, making durable houses for the frontiersmen, and safe retreat
for neighboring settlers.

CONNELLSVILLE; population 13,804. On grounds of the Carnegie Free
Library is a bronze statue of Colonel William Crawford, pioneer and
patriot, who, in 1765, built the first cabin home within limits of
Connellsville; killed by Indians in 1782; sculptor, Charles S.
Kilpatrick; tablet on base placed by Pennsylvania Historical Commission.
Trinity Lutheran Church, Italian Renaissance; native white sandstone,
trimmed with Indiana limestone; built, 1911; contains copy of
Bougereau’s “Resurrection.” In the tower is chime of twelve bells.
Architect, J. C. Fulton, Uniontown.

Lafayette was entertained, in 1825, at “Friendship Hill” near New
Geneva, the home of Albert Gallatin, member of Congress, Minister
Plenipotentiary from the United States to two courts of Europe, signer
of the Treaty of Ghent, Secretary of the Treasury in Jefferson’s and
Madison’s administrations; the house was built, 1789, enlarged, 1882,
and with the estate of seven hundred acres, is still of great beauty;
Albert Gallatin’s library remains just as he left it, on a high
eminence, overlooking the Monongahela River, on the edge of a precipice
three hundred feet above the river, the view is said to be similar to
that from Heidelberg Castle; the main entrance is near the old
Morgantown Road, an historic highway.

[Illustration: FRANKLIN COUNTY]




XIV

FRANKLIN COUNTY


Formed September 9, 1784; named for Benjamin Franklin, whose fame was
then world-wide. Earliest settlers Scotch-Irish, later Germans. Chief
industry agriculture, the land east is limestone and very fertile; west,
slate lands prevail, abounding in pure streams and rich meadows; the
Conococheague and Conodoquinet Creeks drain the central part of the
county, they are crossed by many stone arch bridges of graceful
architecture, the most notable is at Hiester’s Mill, three arches. The
principal road, now part of the Lincoln Highway, enters the county near
the historic Thaddeus Stevens Iron Works, built, 1837, at Caledonia,
which comprised about 20,000 acres, now in State Forestry Reservation,
and with the Mont Alto tract, makes a total of about 40,000 acres; the
mill and machinery were entirely destroyed, in 1863, by order of General
Early, on account of Stevens’ well-known activity as an abolitionist;
this road was route of greater part of Lee’s Army to and from the
battlefield of Gettysburg to Chambersburg; site of encampment before the

Historical Society, 1909. The STATE FOREST ACADEMY is here, where the
state educates its foresters, free of all cost; in 1900, the Bureau of
Forestry had grown to the point where it should be raised to the rank of
a department, of which the chief should be a member of the Governor’s
cabinet; there was strenuous opposition, but owing to the flood of
letters received by members of the Legislature, from the women of the
State Federated Clubs, the change was made, and Pennsylvania takes a
commanding place in the Forestry and Conservation movement. The WHITE
PINE, STATE SANATORIUM, NO. 1, free for consumptives, is also here, one
of the largest in the world. South is WAYNESBORO; good roads and notably

ranks third in state as to amount of money at interest paying state tax;
notable for fine suburban residences and for Washington’s itinerary and
Camp at Valley Forge, with 11,098 men. The Valley Forge Park Commission
acquired, in 1893, 472 acres, partly in Chester County, to maintain and
preserve forever the Revolutionary camp ground; American army here from
December 19, 1777, to June 19, 1778; soldiers built their huts 16 × 14
feet by 6½ feet high, each to accommodate twelve men, and bore their
sufferings from cold, starvation, and sickness like heroes; facts of
interest are:

Baron von Steuben came from Germany with his secretary, Peter S. Du
Ponceau, after having served as aide-de-camp to Frederick the Great; he
was appointed inspector general of the American army, and gave them
military training and discipline; Mrs. Washington came to Valley Forge
February 27, 1778; on May 18, a detachment under Marquis de Lafayette
moved to Barren Hill, but the British came in force against them, and
they retreated over Matson’s ford, Conshohocken, on a bridge of rafts;
on June 18, British evacuated Philadelphia, June 19, Washington and army
left Valley Forge in pursuit.

A marker is placed where General Sullivan and soldiers built a bridge
across the Schuylkill in 1778;

[Illustration: MONTGOMERY COUNTY]

redoubts and intrenchments have been restored; every point of interest
has been marked with granite tablets by various historical societies,
and by the states whose sons suffered here; bronze equestrian statue of
General Anthony Wayne, sculptor, H. K. Bush-Brown, made, 1908, marks

regiments.

Washington’s headquarters (home of Isaac Potts), open daily, 8 A.M. to 6
P.M., is arranged as when he occupied it; Washington Inn was used as

the symbols of the four Evangelists, the lock has a miniature Liberty
Bell as a keeper, and the sliding bolt passes through the knapsack of a
Continental soldier, guarding the lock; windows in the chapel from
D’Ascenzo Studios. Waterman Monument marks the grave of only identified
soldier buried here.

Across the Schuylkill is Fat Land built by James Vaux; Washington slept
here September 21, 1777; the next day, Sir William Howe came here and
almost caught him. At Port Kennedy, one and one-half miles east of
Valley Forge, prehistoric bones of sabretooth tigers and extinct animals
are found. West of Valley Forge, Mill Grove, built, 1762, still
standing, residence of John James Audubon; here he studied, painted, and
wrote about “Birds of America” that have made him world-famous. Near, at
the mouth of Perkiomen Creek, Washington’s army encamped at Richardson’s
Ford, September 21, after marching all night, wet breast-high, and
hungry, one thousand men without shoes. Howe moved on west of Schuylkill
toward Reading, the depot of American supplies, having burned buildings
at Valley Forge on his way, and reached Phœnixville, Fountain Inn.
Washington marched his troops to Upper Hanover, within four miles of
Pottstown; his headquarters was residence of John Potts, built 1753; and
sent General Wayne with fifteen hundred men to harass the rear of
British army under General Gray, but they were outnumbered by the
British, and massacred at Paoli; marked by two monuments.

Not until William Penn came was any effort made to manufacture iron in
Pennsylvania. Having iron furnaces of his own at Hawkhurst, England, he
was interested to encourage the industry here. Thomas Rutter, Bailiff of
Germantown from 1705-06, after Pastorius, moved up the Schuylkill on
patent of land from William Penn, deed still in the family, and
established in 1717, the “Pool Forge,” on Manatawny Creek, three miles
above Pottstown; he was first in Pennsylvania to manufacture iron; ore
is still being mined from the same beds. Among the great names in our
early iron industry, Rutter and Potts stand pre-eminent; the list of
forges and furnaces on the Manatawny and its branches, owned by their
intermarried families, before the Revolution, include Mount Pleasant
furnace and forge; Spring forge; Colebrookdale furnace and forge; Amity
forge; Rutter’s forge; Pool forges; Pine forge and Little Pine forge.

Near Boyertown is Ringing Rocks, a natural curiosity; they make a
complete octave. Michael Schlatter preached at Manatawny in 1748, also
in the Reformed Church, built in 1743. McCalls, or Glasgow Forge, on
Manatawny Creek, still in operation, was erected in 1725, on land
conveyed by William Penn to his son, John, in 1701; 14,600 acres; sold
to George McCall of Glasgow, Scotland, in 1735; who also had interest in
Colebrookdale furnace managed by Thomas Potts, Jr., which supplied
McCall’s forge with pig iron. Green Lane Forge, on Perkiomen Creek,
notable for its excellent blooms, was built in 1733 by Thomas Mayberry;

XVII

LUZERNE COUNTY


Formed September 25, 1786; named in honor of Anne Cæsar, Chevalier de la
Luzerne, minister from France to the United States 1779-83. Ranks third
in number of inhabitants of Pennsylvania counties. Along either bank of
the Susquehanna, a broad and shallow river, lie rich, fertile, alluvial
bottom lands, mostly well cultivated; bounding them are ranges of hills
and mountains 1200-1600 feet above sea level; other mountains in the
northwest of the county attain an altitude of 2200 feet. In the
northeast lies the historic Wyoming Valley, Indian name, Maughwauwama,
or large plains, a long, oval basin from Campbell’s Ledge to Nanticoke
Falls, some sixteen miles in length, with an average breadth of three
miles.

Luzerne County lies within the limits of the Connecticut Charter,
granted in 1662, and within the limits of the Pennsylvania Charter
granted in 1681; this double ownership caused much contention in later
years, finally the Susquehanna Company of Connecticut was victorious;
settlers now came rapidly, and by 1778 were distributed in several
villages, with schools, churches, and all the characteristics of New
England orderliness and thrift, enthusiasm and devoted patriotism. The
British leader, Colonel John Butler, saw that this settlement was
exposed in position, and that they had sent the

[Illustration: LUZERNE COUNTY]

best part of their militia to serve in Washington’s army, so with a
company of his own rangers, a regiment of Johnson’s Greens, and a band
of Indians, in all about 1200 men, he took the warpath from Niagara;
they journeyed down the Susquehanna in bark canoes, landed above the
settlement, and began their work of murder and plunder, harrowing
incidents are made known by Campbell in his “Gertrude of Wyoming.” The
women and children were placed in the fort. At the junction of Fort and
River Streets, in the borough of FORTY FORT; a conglomerate boulder with
bronze tablet, marks the site of “Forty Fort,” erected by the
Connecticut settlers in 1772. From this fort, on July 3, 1778, the
Wyoming Militia, numbering about 300, mostly old men and boys, marched
forth to oppose the invading British troops and Indians, fight the
Battle of Wyoming, and meet with complete defeat and atrocious massacre,
in which the British officers were unable to set any bounds in the
butchery of their savage allies; next day the fort was taken; the
Indians burned all the houses; the inhabitants fled to the woods, and
the valley was abandoned; a hundred women and children perished of
fatigue and starvation. On Wyoming Avenue in the borough of Wyoming is
the “Wyoming Monument,” marking the burial place of many of the patriots
who were slain in the battle and massacre; dedicated July, 1846.

On Susquehanna Avenue near Seventh Street is “Queen Esther’s Rock,” a
half-breed queen of the Senecas, on which she tomahawked fourteen
prisoners; marked by a tablet, placed by the Daughters of the American
Revolution, bearing this inscription, “Upon this rock the Indian queen
Esther slaughtered the brave patriots taken in the battle of July 3,
1778.” On the bank of the river, near the Pittston Ferry bridge, in the
borough of WEST PITTSTON, is a small monument marking site of Jenkins’
Fort, destroyed by the British and Indians July, 1778. The Battle of
Wyoming, with the subsequent massacre, was one of the important events
of the Revolutionary War, as it led to the sending of the Sullivan
Expedition in 1779 into the country of the Six Nations, whereby the
power of their confederacy was forever broken. WHITE HAVEN Township was
the place of Sullivan’s army encampment, in 1779.

The oldest church in the county is in Forty Fort, not far from the site
of the old fort, interior of the building remains as it was when erected
in 1808; in the burial ground are many old graves, with headstones
bearing quaint inscriptions. Other historic places marked by tablet or
monument are, site of a bridge built by the engineers of General John
Sullivan’s army in the spring of 1779, on the banks of Ten Mile Run,
northwest of Bear Creek Village, marked by boulder with tablet. Place
where two commissioned officers, and three others of General Sullivan’s
army were ambushed and slain by Indians, April, 1779; marked by boulder
with tablet. In the Public Square, WILKES-BARRE, is a monument marking
site of Fort Wilkes-Barre, erected in 1776-77 by the inhabitants of the
town; destroyed by the British and Indians July, 1778. On the river
common, at the foot of Northampton Street, a boulder, with tablet, marks
the site of Fort Wyoming, erected, 1771, demolished in 1774 or 1775.
And at the foot of South Street a boulder, with tablet, is erected near
the site of Fort Durkee, built in 1769 by first settlers from
Connecticut, named for their leader, Major John Durkee, who founded and
named Wilkes-Barre in honor of John Wilkes and Colonel Barre; this fort
fell into decay prior to 1776, it was located near site of a village
occupied from 1758-63 by a band of Delaware Indians under “King”
Tedyuscung.

WILKES-BARRE, county seat, was settled, 1772, population, 73,833. Places
of modern interest, containing historical collections, portraits, and
paintings, open free to the public, are the Courthouse, modified
adaptation of classic, the façade, with Ionic porch, is very dignified,
surmounted by a Gustavino dome; architects, Osterling, McCormick &
French; said to be one of the handsomest and most elaborately decorated
courthouses in this country; contains mural paintings by E. H.
Blashfield, Kenyon Cox, Will H. Low, William T. Smedley, C. D. Hinton,
and others. Irem Temple, Moorish design, with tall slender minarets at
each corner. Osterhout Free Library, Gothic. Wyoming Historical and
Geological Society. The Second National Bank, with interesting Ionic
porch at entrance, steel frame, faced with brick and concrete,
architects, McCormick & French. First Presbyterian Church and St.
Stephen’s Protestant Episcopal Church contain handsome memorial tablets
and stained glass windows; a fine bronze relief, by J. Massey Rhind, is
in St. Stephen’s. In the Coal Exchange Building is the Atherton Atelier,
T. H. Atherton, Jr., Superintendent, Architecture, in coöperation with
Society of Beaux Arts. Particular care has been given to improving the
public parks located in different parts of the city. Public square in
center, and the river commons, stretching along the bank of the
Susquehanna for a considerable distance, are attractive and noteworthy.
Opposite the city, across the river, is Riverside Park, chiefly a
natural grove of old trees.

The principal educational institution is Wyoming Seminary, co-ed, at
KINGSTON, founded in 1844, conducted under auspices of the Wyoming
Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, ranks high as a college
preparatory school and has an academic art course. There are many places
of scenic beauty; notably the Conyngham dairy and stock farms at
Hillside, just outside Wyoming Valley, on the road from Kingston to
Harvey’s Lake, which is 1226 feet above sea level; one of the largest
stock farms in the state, covering 651 acres. Sugarloaf Valley, not far
from HAZLETON. The Hazleton Country Club. Glen Summit Springs and the
neighboring country, Bear Creek Village, and Wyoming Valley, viewed
either from Campbell’s Ledge, Mount Lookout, or Prospect Rock.

The principal roads are maintained in good order, and there are no toll
roads in the county. For many years the chief industry has been the
mining of anthracite coal, discovered here in 1762; for a considerable
period it stood first among the counties in annual output; first
development of this coal for shipping to market from the Wyoming region
was in 1776, when two Durham boats purchased cargoes from a mine
operated by R. Greer, near Wyoming. There are many large manufactories.
Within a ten mile circle, having Wilkes-Barre public square as its
center, there were, according to the United States census of 1910,
thirty-three smaller municipalities, cities, boroughs, and hamlets,
having a total population, including Wilkes-Barre, of 266,951. The other
principal towns of this county are Hazleton, population 32,277;
Nanticoke, 22,614; Plymouth, 16,500; Pittston, 18,497; West Pittston,
6968; Kingston, 8952. Peter Frederick Rothermel, prominent historical
painter, was born in Nescopeck, this county, in 1817.

[Illustration: HUNTINGDON COUNTY]

HUNTINGDON COUNTY


Formed September 20, 1787; named by Provost William Smith, of the
University of Pennsylvania, in honor of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon,
a benefactress of the University; lies within the central mountainous
region, being drained by the Juniata. Many fine farms are on the rich
soil of the river flats. Juniata iron early became famous, and numerous
iron works were erected; the old Bedford Furnace was near Orbisonia.
Abundance, variety, and value of the ores; rich and convenient deposits
of limestone; contiguity of the Broad Top, Allegheny and Cumberland coal
fields, combine to indicate the importance of this country. Other
industries are coal-mining, lumber, agriculture, and manufactories.
Large water-power dams of the Pennsylvania Central, and Raystown Water
Power Companies generate electric light and power.

HUNTINGDON, county seat; population 7051, largest town on the Juniata.
The first white visitors to this region were traders, in traffic with
Indians, exchanging goods for furs and skins. On incursions, made before
the middle of the eighteenth century, they found a tribe, a branch of
the Six Nations, located on the now southeast portion of this borough,
their wigwams circling around a pillar of stone, 14 feet high and 6
inches square, covered with hieroglyphics supposed to be a record of
their history and achievements. This tribe, besides hunting and fishing,
had cleared land and cultivated corn. This stone was regarded with
great veneration by the natives; here they had assembled for centuries
to hold their grand councils; its conspicuous position and appearance
led the white visitors to name the locality, “Standing Stone,” it stood
above Second Street, on or near 208 Allegheny Street. Conrad Weiser, in
1748, and John Harris, in 1754, in accounts of their journeys to the
Ohio River, both describe this stone.

The Proprietaries of this province, ever mindful of the rights of the
Indians, would not grant lands, nor permit settlements to be made until
the Indian title had been purchased; at a treaty held in Albany, in
1754, the Six Nations, consisting of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas,
Cayugas, Senecas, and Tuscaroras, executed a deed to the Proprietaries
for a large portion of the province, including the whole valley of the
Juniata; soon after, the resident tribe migrated, and, it is supposed,
carried the stone with them. The seal of the borough has, as its central
figure, a Standing Stone. A second stone was erected by the settlers;
and in 1896 a third, at Penn and Third Streets; as a memorial of the
ancient standing stone of the Indians. Fort Standing Stone was built
here at an early date; site about intersection of Penn and Second
Streets, it was stockaded and provided with barracks, blockhouses, and
magazines constructed of heavy hewn timber, and was the place of many
important incidents during troublesome times following the defeat of
General Braddock in 1755, and until peace was made with Great Britain in
1783.

Provost William Smith, D.D., obtained the land in 1766 from George
Croghan, and numerous other tracts in the vicinity, and in 1767 caused
the town of Huntingdon to be laid out, now on the William Penn Highway;
the proprietor donating plots of ground for a public school, cemetery,
and to each of six prominent religious denominations. About 1797 a post
office was established here, and John Cadwallader was appointed
postmaster; a weekly mail was carried between Harrisburg and Huntingdon.
The most important public buildings, architecturally, are Juniata
College, nine buildings, erected 1878-1916; the older buildings are
colonial; Library, Gothic, red brick with terra-cotta trimmings, built,
1907; contains memorial windows; the Church of the Brethren on the
college campus, Gothic; McGee sandstone; erected, 1910; members of this
sect settled in this county in 1775; and the J. C. Blair Memorial
Hospital, Spanish mission style, light buff brick and Indiana limestone
trimmings, on a commanding position overlooking the town. E. L. Tilton,
New York, architect, also of the College Library and Church of the
Brethren.

Among the places of historic interest in the county are Fort Shirley,
built, 1755, on bluff near site of Indian town of Aughwick, now
Shirleysburg. McAlevey’s Fort, at the head of Standing Stone Creek
Valley, named for Captain William McAlevey, afterwards general in the
Revolutionary War. Warm Springs, five miles northeast of Huntingdon,
known, in 1775, as a resort for invalids. Pulpit Rocks on the Warriors
Ridge, on the old pike between Huntingdon and Alexandria. And Jack’s
Narrows, where the Juniata River cuts through Jack’s Mountain, west of
Mount Union. The Pennsylvania Canal extended through this county from
Shaver’s Aqueduct, below Mount Union, to line of Blair County, above
Water Street; here in Indian times canoes came to receive supplies of
lead. Two miles east is ALEXANDRIA, laid out, 1793; in 1800 the turnpike
was completed to Alexandria, and stage service to Harrisburg began; fare
charged travelers was six cents a mile; this town was the shipping point
of grain for the rich Hart’s Log and Shaver’s Creek valleys.




XIX

ALLEGHENY COUNTY


Formed September 24, 1788; named from Delaware Indian word signifying
“Fair Water.” Surface undulating, many elevations being precipitous. Is
the center of one of the richest bituminous coal and natural gas
districts in the world. Oil fields lie mainly in basins of Allegheny and
Ohio Rivers. Staple manufactures are iron, steel and glass. The history
of Allegheny County presents a greater variety of startling incidents
than almost any other portion of the state. Mound builders were primeval
inhabitants, site of ancient fortifications are on Chartier’s Creek,
eight miles from PITTSBURGH, county seat, second city in size in the
state, on site of Shannopin’s Town, chief of about twenty families of
Delawares; he attended councils with the Governor; his name is signed on
several state archives. By it ran the main Indian path from east to
west.

Washington first came to “The Forks,” in 1753, on way to Fort Le Boeuf.
The French possessed it as Fort Duquesne 1754-58, when it was conquered
by General Forbes; General Stanwix erected a stockade and named it Fort
Pitt, for the British premier. In 1764, Colonel Bouquet built a redoubt
on site of the Fort; old brick blockhouse is still standing, Penn Avenue
near Second Street. First town of Pittsburgh built near the Fort in
1760, inhabitants enjoyed

[Illustration: ALLEGHENY COUNTY]

comparative quiet until 1763, when Pontiac’s War broke out and they were
completely surrounded by savages, later rescued by Colonel Bouquet. In
1811 first steamboat ever run on western waters was launched at
Pittsburgh, the “New Orleans.” In 1839 first iron steamboat made in the
United States, the “Valley Forge,” was built here.

The sister city, ALLEGHENY, north side, was incorporated with Pittsburgh
in 1907, combined population 588,343. An art commission was organized,
1911, for an improvement in public works of art in Pittsburgh, and to
educate public sentiment for civic beautification; in 1915, E. H.

exquisitely designed bronze doors, wrought in relief, with bronze
statues, Bach and Shakespeare, at either side. These bronzes were
designed and modeled in the studio of J. Massey Rhind, and cast in
Naples. Foyer to the Music Hall is considered the most beautiful portion
of the Institute; here are twenty-four huge columns of Tinos marble,
with gilded Corinthian capitals; and one of the finest organs in the
world, on which the greatest organists obtainable give concerts of
highly classical music, which are free, every Saturday night and Sunday
afternoon. The great Archer, Queen Victoria’s Jubilee organist, held
this position for many

MIFFLIN COUNTY


Formed September 19, 1789; named for General Thomas Mifflin, then
President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, 1788-90, and
first Governor under the Constitution of 1790. Scenery throughout is
very beautiful; the twelve mile stretch of State highway through the
famous long Lewistown Narrows, gives glimpses of the Juniata, the
peerless little river of more song and romance than any other in
America, made famous by Mrs. Sullivan’s song, “The Beautiful Blue
Juniata,” telling the love story of Alfarata, the roving Indian girl;
the space between the mountains is barely wide enough to contain the
highway, canal, river, and railroad. Mountains slope one thousand feet
and are popular hunting grounds for bear and wild turkeys; quite a
number of caves are found in the limestone formations of this county,
though not easily accessible; Alexander’s, in Kishacoquillas Valley,
abounds in stalactites and stalagmites, preserving in midsummer ice
formed in winter; Naginey’s Cave, near Milroy, is most spacious;
Hanawalt’s Cave, near McVeytown, is of vast dimensions and contains
calcareous concretions; crude saltpetre has been obtained here;
McVeytown is birthplace of Joseph Trimble Rothrock, M.D.

Celebrated springs are Mifflin, near Painterville Station, has medicinal
waters; and Logan’s, six miles from Lewistown, near Reedsville, on left
of the old

[Illustration: MIFFLIN COUNTY]

stage road between Lewistown and Bellefonte, Center County; here the
Mingo Chief, Logan, friend of white man, Shikellimy’s son, had his
cabin, prior to 1771, when he left this region; he made the famous
speech sent to Lord Dunmore in 1774, considered, among American
classics, as a rare specimen of Indian oratory: “I appeal to any white
man to say if ever he entered Logan’s cabin hungry, and he gave him not
meat; if he ever came cold and naked, and he clothed him not; during the
course of the last long bloody war Logan remained idle in his cabin, an
advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites that my countrymen
pointed at me as they passed, and said: ‘Logan is the friend of white
men.’ I had even thought to have lived with you, but for the injuries of
one man, Colonel Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood and unprovoked,
murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and
children; there runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living
creature; this called on me for revenge; I have sought it; I have killed
many; I have glutted my vengeance; for my country, I rejoice at the
beams of peace, but do not think that mine is the joy of fear; Logan
never felt fear. Logan will not turn on his heel to save his life; who
is there to mourn for Logan? Not one!” (Colonel Michael Cresap was not
responsible for the murder of Logan’s family; some white men, led by a
liquor dealer, murdered them.)

First settlers, Scotch-Irish, in 1754, were not molested by Indians
until 1756. Fort Granville was built, one mile northwest of Lewistown,
on the old turnpike, site to be marked by the Pennsylvania State
Historical Society; it was destroyed when the canal was constructed. In
1829 the Pennsylvania Canal was opened and first packet boat run from
Lewistown to Mifflintown. Chief industries are agriculture, and iron and
steel works. Iron ore of the best quality abounds; two furnaces,
belonging to the Glamorgan Iron Company, were destroyed in July, 1874,
by a tornado that left scarcely a property without damage; the bridge
over the Juniata was also destroyed, rebuilt, and again destroyed by ice
freshets in December, 1874, and February, 1875. In Limestone Ridge,
extending from Kishacoquillas Creek, is found hard, white sandstone,
almost pure silicon, used in glass manufacture.

LEWISTOWN, population 9849, made county seat, 1790, was at first
Kishacoquillas’ Village, a chief of the Shawnees, with a population in
1731, of twenty families, located at the mouth of the stream.
Courthouse, facing the square, brick, colonial with Ionic portico, and
cupola, built, 1843, enlarged in the rear. Granite monument, dedicated,
1906, in honor of Mifflin County soldiers and sailors, is in the square.
One block away on South Main Street is the Kishacoquillas Creek bridge,
stone and concrete, built, 1902, a reconstruction of the old two-arch
stone bridge built in 1807, the first was wood, in 1794; on the left is
an old stone building, erected about 1794, a historic landmark that has
served for many uses, once the “Seven Stars Inn,” 1828-29; also a
Masonic hall, 1830-39, it has two cellars, one beneath the other. At a
point along the creek, just above the old building, is where Commodore
David Conner, as a boy, made little boats and pitted

[Illustration: OLD STONE ARCH ON JACK’S CREEK

them against each other in mimic warfare, thus foreshadowing his
brilliant naval career in the War of 1812 and the Mexican War. Just
above, on the high bank, fronting on Water and Brown Streets, is
Lewistown’s oldest burial grounds. Here are the graves of the Buchanan
family, first settlers and owners of the land on which Lewistown is
built. One mile east of Lewistown, on the oldest wagon and stage road
running parallel with the present state highway, is an old stone arch
bridge, over one hundred years old, a favorite subject for artists; it
is near the bridge crossing Jacks Creek, on the state highway through
Lewistown Narrows. MOUNT UNION, on southern boundary, lies at entrance
to Jacks Narrows, made by the river forcing its way through Jacks
Mountain.

BARTRAM’S GARDEN, 28 acres, open free to the public, one quarter mile
south on Fifty-fourth Street, first botanical garden of international
importance in United States; ground purchased by John Bartram, in 1728;
from here he traveled long distances to Florida, the Adirondacks,
everywhere collecting rare plants that he brought home in his
saddlebags; he wrote down the results of his explorations, and sent to
Europe botanical specimens of great interest, also painted sheets of
illustrations, sending one set to the South Kensington Museum, London,
which are still there in perfect condition; Linnæus proclaimed him the
greatest natural botanist in the world, and sent him books and
apparatus; his quaint old stone house is still standing, built by
himself in 1731; his son, William Bartram, botanist and ornithologist,
published the most complete list of American birds, previous to
Alexander Wilson, whom he greatly assisted. Wilson lived at the corner
of Fifty-first Street and Woodland Avenue, in a log house with an
immense stone chimney. Near Bartram’s Garden, on the Schuylkill River
bank, at the western end of Gray’s Ferry Bridge, is site of Gray’s
Garden, pleasure resort, time of Washington, reached from Philadelphia
by a floating bridge, replaced by wooden telescope drawbridge built in
1808, by the P., W. & B. R. R.; stone monument, still standing, covered
with most interesting and historically valuable inscriptions, marks

great munition factories into CHESTER, population 58,030, settled by
Swedes about 1644, the oldest town in Pennsylvania, known as Upland
until 1682, when Penn, landing here on October 28, named it Chester
after the home of his companion, Pearson, in England. Penn convened
here, in November, 1682, the first Assembly of the Province, at which
was passed the “Great Law”; the Upland court was held here from 1668 to
1682; the courts of Chester County from 1682 until their removal to West
Chester in 1786, and the courts of Delaware County from 1789 to 1851;
Chester has grown from an ancient country town to a bustling industrial
city, but many antiquities are preserved; principal among these are the
old City Hall, stone, with pent roof projection and quaint clock tower,
erected in 1724; the oldest public building in Pennsylvania, and one of
the oldest in America; used as Chester County courthouse for sixty-two
years, Delaware County courthouse for sixty-one years, and as hall of

[Illustration: SOMERSET COUNTY]

SOMERSET COUNTY


Formed April 17, 1795; named for Somerset, England. Chief industries are
agriculture and mining. A mountain country of remarkable beauty, largely
forests, although glades, or natural meadows, about the headwaters of
streams are numerous and extensive enough to have the name, “The
Glades,” applied to the whole county; standing on the summit of either
mountain range that bounds it, east and west, one gets a view of
unsurpassed beauty; at distance of twenty miles the other stands out in
bold outline, with intervening country of hill, valley, forest, glade,
and numerous watercourses, which find their way to the Ohio,
Susquehanna, and Potomac rivers; immortalized in James Whitcomb Riley’s
“’Mongst the Hills of Somerset.”

Nearly all this country, between the crests of the Allegheny Mountains
and Laurel Hills, is one vast coal field, extending over the entire
length, from Maryland to Cambria County, every vein of coal from the
great Pittsburgh seam down being represented. Traditions of Indian
villages are in the famous Turkey Foot, Casselman River forms middle toe
at town of Confluence; also in Elk Lick township, Indian arrowheads and
stone implements are found. In 1749, Christopher Gist, agent of the Ohio
Company, was the first white man known to have crossed Somerset County;
his route, along Nemacolin’s trail, a Delaware Indian chief, led him
through Addison Township and to the, later known, Great Crossing; again
passing through in 1750, he kept a diary.

George Washington in 1753, crossed through Addison Township, with four
frontiersmen, one as Indian interpreter, one French interpreter; every
spot of earth that Washington trod in the line of duty is sacred soil
for all true Americans; he passed through Somerset eleven times; on
Braddock’s ill-fated expedition in 1755, he lay for ten days at Great
Crossing, on a bed of sickness, exempt by order of General Braddock.
First road cut in 1754 was under Washington’s direction, afterwards
substantially the Braddock Road, following Nemacolin’s trail, the chief
who guided him; it began at Cumberland, Maryland, then a fort, and
reached the Youghiogheny River, south of present village of Somerfield,
at the Great Crossing; marked, only historic marker in the county.

The National Turnpike, commenced in 1811, has the same general course,
occasionally using the same roadbed, crosses the Youghiogheny at
Somerfield over a great stone bridge, still in good repair, completed
July 4, 1818, and turned over to the United States on that day.
President James Monroe and members of his Cabinet attended the opening
of the bridge; this road became a great highway, over which passed a
vast commerce, both east and west, wayside inns were nearly every mile,
now none exist; the “Endsley,” stone house, in Somerfield, built, 1818,
long a noted tavern, is now a private residence.

Next great road in the county was the Forbes, or Bouquet Road, cut by
Colonel Bouquet in 1758, it

[Illustration: STEPPING STONES, KIMBERLY RIVER]

traversed the county from east to west, and like the Braddock Road, was
purely military, constructed under protection of a strong army; over it
passed the army of General Forbes on way to conquer Fort Duquesne;
George Washington was with this expedition in command of the first
Virginia regiment. The road started at Bedford and followed an Indian
trail, it was improved between 1785-95 and became known as “The Great
Road”; afterwards about 1806 as the Stoyestown and Bedford Turnpike;
later taken by the State Highway Department, it is now a great speedway,
“The Lincoln Highway,” entering the county at BUCKSTOWN, crossing Stoney
Creek at KANTNER, one mile west is Stoyestown over one hundred years
old; six miles farther west is JENNERSTOWN, laid out in 1822 by General
James Wells, who, in 1771, was wounded by Indians.

On Laurel Hills, three miles west of URSINA, is the Jersey Baptist
Church, with ancient burial ground, has written record since 1775, first
log church built, 1788, twice rebuilt; fine mountain scenery all along
the route, and several places of historic interest, here, and in other
parts of the county, sites of forts which date back to French and Indian
wars and the Revolution, unmarked; few are now living who can point out
the locality of these historic places with any degree of certainty. The
Glades Road, laid out in 1772 from four miles west of Bedford to the
Youghiogheny, via Stoney Creek, was made turnpike in 1816; along this
road in 1810, on a farm nine miles east of Somerset, was born Judge
Jeremiah Sullivan Black, Chief Justice of Pennsylvania; United States
Attorney General; and Secretary of State. First railroad through
Somerset county was the Pittsburgh division of the picturesque Baltimore
& Ohio, opened in 1871, with its famous tunnels. At Mason & Dixon’s line
Negro Mount is about 2825 feet above sea.

SOMERSET, county seat, population 3121; laid out in 1795, elevation
above sea level 2180 feet, has had three consuming fires, and has been
rebuilt with greater beauty. Courthouse built, 1906, French Renaissance,
Indiana limestone, architect, J. H. Fuller, Uniontown; Soldiers’
Monument in grounds, pedestal with names of more than 400 Somerset
County men who died in war for the Union, 1861-65; Somerset Trust
Company, Indiana limestone, built, 1916, architects, Mowbray & Company,
New York, Renaissance, beautiful proportions. Churches, built by E. H.
Walker, Somerset; all with memorial windows, mostly made by Pittsburgh
firms; are, Grace United Evangelical, brick, 1914; the Christian Church
and parsonage, Doric, brick, 1910; St. Paul’s Reformed, Gothic, brick,
remodeled, 1915; also Trinity Lutheran, Corinthian, built, 1877, brick,
architect, M. Simon, Harrisburg. Throughout the county are many
churches; in some places where there is not even the semblance of a
village there are churches that would be a credit to any town.




XXIV

GREENE COUNTY


Formed February 9, 1796; named for General Nathanael Greene. Surface,
fertile valleys, hills, and rolling uplands, making a region of natural
beauty, well watered from the tributaries of the Monongahela River and
Wheeling Creek. There are still a number of covered wooden bridges
throughout the county, from fifty to a hundred years old, a very old
double bridge crosses Ten Mile Creek, one mile east of Waynesburg;
formerly an old forge and furnace were on this creek. Many Indian
village sites that were occupied long before the advent of the whites
are here; their age is indicated by large old trees growing on their
mounds; three distinct forms of ancient burial are found here, showing
that three waves of population swept over this land before the coming of
the Europeans; the two principal Indian mounds now in the county, are at
Crows Mills. Two great Indian trails crossed the southern part of the
state, the Warrior Branch passing through this county to the Ohio River.
A chain of forts crossed Greene Co., ending at Fort Zane, now Wheeling;
three are especially well known--Fort Ryserson and Block House at
western end of county; Fort Jackson west of Waynesburg; and Fort Garard
on Whitely Creek; seven miles west of GREENSBORO, the birthplace of
Robert J. Burdette, and his eminent sister Mary G. Burdette.

[Illustration: GREENE COUNTY]

The earliest glass works were established by Albert Gallatin, on the
Monongahela in 1785; they were the forerunner of the vast business at
Pittsburgh and vicinity. First settlers were Scotch-Irish. Chief
industries, agriculture and the mining of bituminous coal; the
Pittsburgh vein of rich depth and highest coking value, and three other
veins, almost as rich, namely, the Waynesburg, Freeport, and Mapletown.
Oil and gas production is very valuable, there are a number of
gas-pumping stations within the county. The Philadelphia Gas Company has
one at Brave, said to be the largest in the world; near Brave is
JOLLYTOWN, with a monument to Jesse Taylor, first Greene County soldier
to fall in the Civil War.

County seat, WAYNESBURG, population 3332; laid out in 1796; named for
General Anthony Wayne, who with his troops proved most successful in
ridding this section of the Indians. A chain of parks with formal
gardening goes through the center of the town, divided by streets; in
the center of one is the Soldiers’ Monument; erected in 1899; Waynesburg
College, empowered by the Legislature to confer honorary degrees, faces
College Park; portrait of Dr. A. B. Miller, a former president, is in
Alumni Hall. Courthouse, colonial, with cupola, surmounted by wooden
statue of General Greene; was erected in 1852; brick, painted gray, has
six lofty Corinthian columns supporting the front porch. Jail on same
ground.

First Methodist Church, Romanesque, Cleveland stone, has memorial
windows. The public schools are liberally provided with the Elson
photogravures, reproductions of great masterpieces, mostly in sepia.
Five miles southeast of Waynesburg is Gordon Ridge; Nettle Hill sixteen
miles southwest, both notable places of particularly beautiful scenery.
CARMICHAELS, originally New Lisbon, one of the oldest towns, beautifully
located, has Greene Academy, incorporated, 1810; Senator Albert Cummins
was born near here.




XXV

WAYNE COUNTY


Formed March 21, 1798; named for General Anthony Wayne. A picturesque,
mountainous section, possessing more lakes than any other county in the
state, some over 2000 feet above sea, ranging in area from 3 to 358
acres, many of them well stocked with bass, perch, pickerel, and other
fish, while the whole county abounds in trout streams. From north to
south is a wonderful expanse of scenery; FARVIEW, altitude, 1500 feet,
on the Moosic Mountain, near Waymart, includes, in its panorama, the
distant Catskills; from the southern roads, extended views are also
enjoyed. A beautiful drive follows the Wallenpaupack Creek (slow water)
passing the Falls at Hawley, meeting place of the Paupack Indians; good
roads continue to Milford and the Water Gap, or to Gouldsboro, Scranton
and Wilkes-Barre. On the road from Honesdale to Carbondale the path of
the old Delaware & Hudson Gravity Railroad may still be traced.

Early industries were hunting, lumbering, and tanning; now the modern
creamery is an important factor, also stock raising and agriculture. One
hundred years ago a small colony of Germans settled a half mile west of
Bethany and started a glass factory, utilizing native sand and clay;
from 1847 to 1861 window glass was manufactured at Tracyville; in 1865,
Christian Dorflinger built large factories for manufacturing and cutting
glass, at White Mills, five miles south of

[Illustration: WAYNE COUNTY]

Honesdale; glass-cutting factories are now numerous in the county, and
gold decorating of glass has been introduced among Wayne’s industries.

HONESDALE, made the county seat in 1841; population 2756; altitude, 1000
feet; named for Philip Hone, president of the Delaware and Hudson Canal
Company, which started here for tidewater at Rondout on the Hudson,
built 1826-28, abandoned, 1898; Honesdale owes its growth and prosperity
to the canal; it was one of the anthracite stepping stones to a waiting
market. Three locomotives were purchased by the canal company to draw
coal from the mines in Carbondale and vicinity to the canal at
Honesdale; the first one, the Stourbridge Lion, was brought by canal
boat to Honesdale in 1829 and a trial trip was made; the wooden rails,
then used for the railroad, were not firm enough for the strain of the
engine, and it was never run again; however, Wayne County takes
precedence in having had the first locomotive ever run in America make
its trial and only trip at Honesdale; it is now at the Smithsonian
Institute, Washington. The New York & Erie Railroad follows the course
of the old canal through the town.

Courthouse built, 1880; brick with stone trimmings; contains portrait of
General Anthony Wayne, copied from original in Wayne family,
Philadelphia, by Miss Jennie Brownscombe, native of Wayne County; two
large Parrott guns in front are relics of the Civil War. It faces
Central Park, where stands a Soldiers’ Monument, dedicated in 1869 by
Governor John W. Geary; pedestal with bronze plates inscribed with names
of nearly 350 Wayne County men lost in Civil War; also fountain in
center of park, memorial of the National Centennial, both placed by the
women of Honesdale who are said to be the first in the state to organize
a Village Improvement Society; they, aided by the town council, have
done much for the beautifying of the town; the parks have received
special attention; besides Central Park are North Park, and on either
side of the Main Street bridge lie Torrey Park, West, and Riverside
Park, East, overshadowed by Irving Cliff, 300 feet high, named in honor
of Washington Irving, who, while in Honesdale in 1841 with Philip Hone,
climbed to the summit of the ledge overlooking the town.

Grace Protestant Episcopal Church, Gothic, stone, contains white marble
font, good design, gift of Philip Hone, in 1848. Baptist Church, wood,
classic, with Ionic columns supporting the porch, built 1843-45. Glen
Dyberry Cemetery contains grave of Attorney General Samuel E. Dimmick,
died, 1875, marked by granite shaft; his residence, brick, is south of
courthouse. North of Honesdale is stone arched bridge over Carley Brook,
made in 1909; builder, Samuel Brown from England.

BETHANY, first county seat in 1800, was staked out in the primeval
forest. Courthouse, built, 1800, is now used as a store; new courthouse
and brick offices were built 1820-23, the office building still
standing; courthouse was abandoned in 1842, after it was remodeled it
became the University of Northern Pennsylvania, with the public square
as campus, and was burned in 1857. Between the old cemetery and the
street stands the first Presbyterian

[Illustration: RIVERSIDE PARK, IRVING CLIFF, HONESDALE]

church erected in the county, in 1822. Several old dwellings have
beautiful colonial doorways. An old tavern, built by Henry Drinker, in
1802, still stands. PLEASANT MOUNT, altitude, 1600 feet, sixteen miles
north of Honesdale, residence of General Samuel Meredith, officer in the
Revolutionary War, and United States Treasurer under Washington,
commission dated September 11, 1789; he lived near, on manor lands, from
1803-17, said to have been visited by Thomas Jefferson; the house was
burned; granite monument in his honor was erected by the state,
unveiled, 1904, represents a Continental general, from a design by Miss
Clara Keen; architect, Martin Caufield, both of Honesdale.

The Delaware River forms the eastern boundary; a woodland road follows
the river. At MILANVILLE, is the old Skinner house, oldest, still in use
in Wayne County, loopholes near the roof were made for defense against
Indians; many Indian relics were found around here. Wayne County’s only
battlefield, unmarked, is in Sterling township, called “Little Meadows,”
near it passed an old Indian trail, from Delaware River to Wyoming
Valley; on July 4, 1778, the day after the Wyoming Massacre, Indians
attacked a few white people, with loss on both sides. On the Eastern and
Belmont Highway is a nine-sided, stone schoolhouse of early
construction. Three others are found in the county.

Lutheran Theological Seminary, west of town, on Seminary Ridge, contains
large copy of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper,” painted by the late
James B. Sward, Philadelphia; also used as hospital by Union soldiers;
it is said that General Lee took observations from its tower; near, in
Reynolds Grove, General John F. Reynolds was killed, place marked by
bronze equestrian statue, sculptor, H. K. Bush-Brown. In the Dobbin
House, stone, on Steinwehr Avenue, built, 1776, was conducted first
classical school in Pennsylvania, west of the Susquehanna. Southeast
corner of Washington and High Streets was the first home of Pennsylvania

The BATTLE FIELD covered 16,000 acres, not including cavalry field four
miles east; Union Army was commanded by General George G. Meade, 80,000
to 90,000 men; Confederate Army, commanded by General Robert E. Lee,
about 80,000 to 85,000 men; desperate charges were made in hand-to-hand
conflicts. The cyclorama, “Battle of Gettysburg,” painted by Paul
Philippoteaux, is on exhibition. The Gettysburg Battle Field Memorial
Association was incorporated by the Legislature of Pennsylvania to hold
and preserve the battle ground, with natural and artificial defenses, as
at time of battle, and to mark definitely lines of battle of all troops.
It is now a national park and cemetery, in charge of a commission,
appointed by the Secretary of War, including over 7000 acres with fifty
miles of macadam roads amid most beautiful scenery.

address, ending, “This nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
freedom--and that government of the people, by the people, and for the
people, shall not perish from the earth.” Fiftieth anniversary of the
battle, fought July 1-2-3, 1863, was celebrated here in 1913 by reunion
of veterans.

The Russell Tavern, now a residence on old Shippensburg Road, three
miles north of Gettysburg, is where Washington stopped in 1794, after
quelling the Whiskey Rebellion. In Cashtown, the Civic League has formed
a recreation park, using the old tavern for a Library; west of this town
is the old Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Pike, used by both armies during
Civil War. Conewago Mission at Edgegrove was established in 1741 by two
Jesuit missionaries; present church, colonial, stone, was built in 1787;
enlarged, 1851; paintings over the altar and in the transepts were made
by Francis Stecker; Roman Catholic missions were established within a
radius of twenty miles from this mother house.




XXVII

CENTER COUNTY


Formed February 13, 1800; named for its position in center of state;
notable for the State College. Chief industry, agriculture; formerly
mining and manufacture of iron; limestone is extensively quarried; coal
is mined about Philipsburg and Snow Shoe. The state owns 21,000 acres of
forest reserve, through which several of the state highways pass;
“Fireline” cuts made by the state foresters may be seen.

For a wonderful mountain ride, take the State Road from Tyrone, Blair
County, to Bellefonte, following Bald Eagle Valley, and passing several
small towns named for women, where remains of iron furnaces may be seen;
near Snow Shoe Intersection, a state highway leads up the mountain, with
unsurpassed views, to Snow Shoe; follow this road to Philipsburg, then
to Bald Eagle Valley. Another beautiful ride is on the state road from
Mifflinburg, Union County, across the mountain, through Millheim and
Spring Mills to the Old Fort. From Spring Mills a short trip may be made
to Penn’s Cave; this is “Penn’s Grandest Cavern”; the trip through the
cave is 1400 feet in length, made in motor boats carrying torches or
acetylene lights, the water is a transparent greenish color, greatest
depth 35 or 40 feet.

A road from Lewistown, Mifflin County, to Lock Haven via Bellefonte,
crosses the Seven Mountains

[Illustration: CENTER COUNTY]

with wonderful views; at Potter’s Mills is an old furnace and mill. Near
the “Old Fort Tavern” is marker, on site of stockade built in 1768
against Indians, placed by Bellefonte Chapter of Daughters American
Revolution. Leaving Penn Valley, the road crosses Nittany Mountain, Bald
Eagle Mountains may be seen beyond, with crest of Alleghenies in the
background.

From Pleasant Gap a detour may be made to STATE COLLEGE; population
2405; Pennsylvania State College was founded by the United States
Government; in 1862 Congress passed the Land Grant Act, offering to each
state and territory in the Union a gift of public lands, the proceeds
from the sales to provide for the maintenance of a college to promote
the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes, in the
several pursuits and professions of life. The offer was accepted by the
Legislature of this state in 1863, and the institution, then known as
the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania, designated to receive the Land
Grant. There are thirty-four buildings on a campus of 1500 acres; “Old
Main,” built in 1857 as the Agricultural College of Pennsylvania, native
limestone, is fine specimen of early architecture; the chemistry and
liberal arts buildings are Classic style; mining and agricultural
groups, Italian Renaissance.

The college maintains departments of study in industrial and fine arts,
architecture, art history, and engineering; architectural exhibitions
show many specimens of students’ work, some of them prize winners in the
Beaux Arts contests; the ornamental gateway, a gift of the class of
1916, was designed by the students. College Museum contains, among the
portraits, those of the seven Presidents of the college, and Governor
Beaver, also other paintings, marbles and metal work. Art is being
emphasized in the summer school. Auditorium presented by Charles Schwab,
Esq., has in the lobby, heroic statue, “The Hewer,” by George Gray
Barnard. Opposite on the campus is the Carnegie Library; architects,
Seymour Davis and Paul A. Davis.

Near State College is a picturesque village, BOALSBURG, laid out with a
small formal center square, from which streets radiate toward the
distant mountains. Colonel Theodore Boal, architect, who raised and
equipped a machine gun company for the World War, has created a museum
for his warfare collections, curious old armor, dating back to the
Crusaders, and a large amount of World War relics, German airplanes,
helmets, gas masks, etc.; there is also a Napoleon Room; and he has
erected a chapel, old Spanish model, which houses rare wall hangings,
vestments, church furnishings, and manuscripts in Spanish, dating from
the time of Columbus; they were inherited by Mrs. Boal, a direct
descendant from Columbus. Colonel Boal also keeps up, on his property, a
reservation or captain’s camp, for the Twenty-eighth Division, the Iron
Division.

BELLEFONTE, county seat, population 3996, was founded, 1795, by James
Harris and Colonel James Dunlop, who gave the ground for the courthouse
and academy; and certain lots, to be sold, to provide for the erection
of said buildings. Name said to have been suggested by Talleyrand, who
visited James Harris at his home “Marlbrook,” now the Bellefonte Poor
House;

[Illustration: COURT HOUSE AND GOVERNOR CURTIN MEMORIAL, BELLEFONTE]

being asked by Mrs. Harris to suggest a name for the town he said,
“Bellefonte, for this beautiful spring”; the spring is computed to flow
14,600 gallons per minute, and scarcely varies, entire supply being
conveyed to the borough. It is a conservative and aristocratic old town,
with residences of Governors Curtin, Beaver, and Hastings, whose homes
may still be seen; and fine old colonial doorways; the library of Judge
Ellis L. Orvis is noted for its rare first editions, one of the best in
Pennsylvania.

Courthouse is in the Public Square, built, 1805, Greco-colonial, with
Ionic columns, architect, probably Ezra Ale, has been twice enlarged
without changing the front; entrance to the east addition harmonizes
with the main west front; architects, Newman & Harris, Philadelphia, for
enlargement in 1911. Contains portraits of past judges of the county. In
the diamond, in front of courthouse, is state memorial to Pennsylvania’s
War Governor and United States Ambassador to Russia, Andrew G. Curtin;
bronze, heroic, portrait statue on granite pedestal, sculptor, W. Clark
Noble; on either side are bronze panels giving names of Center County’s
soldiers in wars of the Republic. The Bellefonte Academy, founded in
1805, burned 1905, was rebuilt, classic, architect, Robert Cole of
Bellefonte.

[Illustration: BEAVER COUNTY]

BEAVER COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800; named for one of our most industrious little
animals; was in the track of earliest of French and English explorers of
the Mississippi Valley, to which the Ohio River Valley forms an integral
part. It was the scene of heroic labors of Moravian and Jesuit
missionaries, who built their stations on the borders of the Beaver
River. The Indian villages were the homes of some of the most noted
warriors of the aboriginal tribes, and sites of important treaty
conferences between them and the colonial governments of Pennsylvania
and Virginia. Chief industries are coal and steel. Yards of the
Pennsylvania Railroad at Conway, said to be the largest in the world;
the famous glass factories of Rochester and Monaca, are at junction of
the Ohio and Beaver rivers. Four bridges are here, including that of the
Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad, a massive structure of fine
engineering skill, 90 feet above the river.

BEAVER, county seat (Indian, Shingoes Town), population 4135, was laid
out in 1791, on a high level plateau overlooking the Ohio River, by the
Surveyor General of the state. Five streets, 100 feet wide, following
direction of river, were planned, with five of same width crossing at
right angles, and each square divided again by streets 25 feet in width;
eight squares were reserved for use of the town, one at each corner,
north, east, south and west, and four in the center, which, with a wide
strip fronting the river, constitute the parks; all beautifully laid
out, they have large trees, and are planted with ornamental shrubbery.
The present added territory, east and west, makes the town twice the
original size. Courthouse, brick with stone trimmings, is on one of the
center squares; the jail, a quaint old stone building, faces on opposite
square; in center stands the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument. At foot of
Market Street is a tall flagstaff marking site of Fort McIntosh, built,
1778, by General McIntosh, on earlier site of a French town built in
1754.

BEAVER FALLS, population 12,802, oldest and largest manufacturing town,
consequent on the great water power of Beaver River and Falls, has
Geneva College and a fine Carnegie Library. The residence section is on
a bluff 200 feet high, with fine view. NEW BRIGHTON, population 9361,
connected with Beaver Falls by bridges, has the Merrick Art Galleries,
acquired by gift to the city, with collection of paintings of merit and
value, and liberal endowment for purpose of adding to the collection,
library, museum, and to employ teachers in the future. Armory is
headquarters of the famous Tenth Regiment. Near the town is a ravine,
through which flows Brady’s Run, scene of many thrilling events in life
of the famous Indian fighter, Captain Samuel Brady. Morado has a
beautiful park on the Beaver River. At Rock Point, on the
Connoquenessing Creek, is wild and tumultuous scenery.

LEGIONVILLE, General Anthony Wayne wintered his soldiers here in 1792;
the trenches and position of some of the redoubts are still
discernible; marked by flagstaff, erected by the Fort McIntosh Chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolution. Farther east is quaint old town of
ECONOMY, home of the Harmony Society, disciples of Doctor Rapp; thrifty,
industrious people of the past, almost effaced by the town of Ambridge,
of the American Bridge Company, who purchased a large tract of their
land.

Near Smith’s Ferry, on the north bank of the Ohio, is large group of
interesting Indian picture carvings, cut into the surface of the
Piedmont sandstone, exposed in the river at a three foot stage of water;
they are scattered over the surface of the rock ledge, for a space about
forty feet in width, and 700 feet in length, and represent a great
variety of the forms of men and animals, birds, fish, and reptiles,
including the beaver, bear, wolf, turtle, snake, and eagle, human
footprints and the tracks of various beasts; as well as inanimate
objects, scalphoop, bows, and arrows; there is also a picture of a bison
chasing a dog; another large collection of similar pictures, on the
Susquehanna River at Safe Harbor, Lancaster County, contains the same
forms of the wolf and the turtle, from which well-known tribes of the
Delaware Indians were named, which would seem to connect them with that
tribe; casts and photographs of these carvings may be seen at the
Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.

CRAWFORD COUNTY


Formed March 20, 1800; named for Colonel William Crawford. First well in
the world drilled for petroleum, was completed here in 1859; valley of
Oil Creek, south of Titusville, once most productive of oil in United
States. Land peculiarly suited to grazing, stock raising, and general
farming. French Creek was followed by Washington, 1753, from Franklin,
Venango County, to Fort Le Breuf, Erie County. He returned, descending
it in canoe; on French Creek, north of Meadville, are Saegerstown and
Cambridge Springs, with famous health-giving waters. Conneaut Lake,
three and one-half miles by one mile, is largest lake in Pennsylvania,
covering about 1200 acres.

MEADVILLE, county seat, population 14,568, settled in 1788 by David

Messenger,” published by Thomas Atkinson at Meadville, first newspaper
northwest of the Allegheny Mountains; annual exhibitions of paintings by
American artists are held here; an excellent permanent collection is
being accumulated by the art association, among the artists represented
are Charles C. Curran, Charles Bittinger, and Charlotte B. Coman.

Allegheny College founded in 1815, co-ed, is well equipped as to
instructors, apparatus, and buildings, campus twenty acres, nearly one
million dollars endowment; Bentley Hall, the oldest building, erected in

library, one of the rarest in the country.

The Pennsylvania College of Music, chartered, 1887, is complete in its
faculty and curriculum, for study in every department of music and
allied arts. Meadville Theological School, chartered 1846, contains a
fine library; in the chapel is a portrait, by John Neagle, Philadelphia,

XXX

ERIE COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800; named for Lake Erie, the name Erie from a tribe
of Indians, Eries, conquered by the Iroquois Confederacy in 1653, their
identity and language is lost; curious mounds and circular embankments,
still found in several places, show traces of a race superior to the
Indians; human bones in large quantities have been unearthed on line of
the Pennsylvania and Erie Railroad, indicating huge physical
development, one was nine feet in height. The triangle north of
Pennsylvania and west of New York was purchased, by authority of
Governor Mifflin, in 1791, from the United States, to obtain a lake port
for the state; conveyance being signed by President Washington and
Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State; afterwards the Indian title was
purchased from the Six Nations, through the diplomacy of Cornplanter
(Gyantwachia), the Seneca chief, for which the state gave him a
reservation in Warren County; later the Indians resolved to prevent the
settlement of Presque Isle by Americans, but General Wayne gained a
decisive and final victory against them in the battle of “Fallen
Timbers” on Maumee Road in 1794.

The Shore belt, for ten miles in width, is noted for grape and fruit
raising; back of this is a productive agricultural section. Iron and
steel industries predominate. Principal roads are along the south shore
of Lake Erie, called the East and West Lake Roads,

[Illustration: Erie County]

[Map of Erie County showing: City of ERIE; Towns of EDINBORO, WATERFORD,
and LE BOEUF; Railroad lines of the Pennsylvania Railroad, New York
Central, and New York Chicago & St. Louis; _LAKE ERIE_; PRESQUE ISLE;
and WALNUT, ELK, CONNEAUT, and FRENCH Creeks]

that form a fifty-mile section of the international touring route across
the continent. The old French Road from Erie southeast to Waterford, 18
miles, was originally part of the stage route between Pittsburgh and
Erie, and also the old portage route from Lake Erie, for military and
commercial purposes, to the head waters of the Allegheny River
navigation, at Fort Le Boeuf, Waterford, on Lake Le Boeuf.

In 1753, Major George Washington, twenty-one years old, first caught the
attention of mankind; he came with a message from Governor Dinwiddie of
Virginia, to notify the French to discontinue fortifying Presque Isle
and Le Boeuf, claiming them to be British territory. Captain Riparti
came from Presque Isle for the conference. Washington was accompanied by
Christopher Gist (White) and an Indian interpreter. They were in Fort Le
Boeuf from December 11-16, and treated courteously by the French
officers, who stated they would communicate with their superior officer,
Marquis Du Quesne, but at present must refuse to comply.

ERIE, county seat, population 93,372, on site of Presque Isle Fort,
built by the Marquis Du Quesne in 1753; one of the chain of thirteen
French forts extending from Quebec to Fort Du Quesne; is 35 feet above
the lake, 573 feet above sea level. Surveyed by Andrew Ellicott, in
1795, first Surveyor General of the United States, three public parks of
five acres each were in the original plan, along Sixth street, one mile
apart. Perry Square, Sixth and State Streets, on original plan, is focus
of public life, it contains memorial monuments to Captain Charles V.
Gridley, bronze statue, erected in 1913, commander of the flagship of
Admiral Dewey’s Squadron, in Manila Bay; Eben Brewer, bronze statue,
first American postmaster in Cuba; General Anthony Wayne, large granite
boulder surmounted by two cannon, erected, 1902; and bronze statue to
Civil War soldiers, erected, 1872.

Courthouse, facing Perry Square, classic, Corinthian columns, native
stone, erected in 1852, the bell is a trophy of war, from the British
battleship _Queen Charlotte_, in 1813; court room contains complete
representation of portraits of Erie County judges. Public Library, South
Perry Square, Italian Renaissance, granite, built in 1897, architects,
Alden & Harlow, Pittsburgh, contains portraits of Commodore Perry,
General Anthony Wayne, Captain Charles V. Gridley, President Lincoln; in
the Art Gallery is a small permanent collection of works by American
artists, among those represented are Childe Hassam, R. M. Shurtleff, F.
S. Church, George R. Barse, Arthur Parton, H. Bolton Jones, Charles A.
Hulbert, and Henry Mosler; annual art exhibitions are held here by the
Erie Art Club.

The Library also has a museum, with relics of the French and Indian, the
Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and later wars. Erie has a
conservatory of music, with an organized symphony orchestra, and glee
club. The old Custom House, State Street, north of Perry Square, built
in 1837, classic, brick with white marble steps and Doric columns, was
first used as a United States bank, now in possession of the Grand Army
of the Republic. Erie has fifty-five churches, eighteen missions, and

[Illustration: WASHINGTON STATUE

_Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Kilpatrick, Sculptors_]

other religious societies, also two cathedrals. St. Paul’s, Protestant
Episcopal, West Sixth Street, Gothic, stone, built, 1866, architect, St.
John of Detroit, rose window by Tiffany, who also made some of the
memorial windows; St. Peter’s Roman Catholic, Tenth and Sassafras
Streets, Gothic; Medina New York red sandstone, trimmed with white
sandstone from Amherst, Ohio, and Mercer County, Pennsylvania, built in
1893, architect, C. C. Keely, New York; contains statues of St. Peter
and St. Paul, Carrara marble, made in Italy; stations and stained glass
windows from Munich, Germany; other windows made in this country.
Memorial windows are also in the First Presbyterian Church; St. Mary’s
and St. John Kanty (Polish).

The State Soldiers and Sailors’ Home and Marine Hospital, built,
1867-68, brick and stone, is located on the lake front; on the grounds
is a replica of the original blockhouse fort, where General Anthony
Wayne died in 1796, after his conquest of the Northwest in 1795; he was
buried here, until his body was removed in 1809 to St. David’s burial
ground, Radnor. The blockhouse, showing plan of construction, was built
in 1880, as memorial to General Wayne, it contains relics, and part of
coffin lid with his inscription; these grounds were the reservation, on
old City Plan of 1795, set apart for fortifications, in the most
commanding position, for protection to entrance of harbor. Most of the
military history of Erie is interwoven with the location between Parade
and Wayne Streets, north of Fifth Street; here was the first white
settlement, Presque Isle Village, and French fort in 1753. On bluff near
Parade Street, blockhouses were erected, 1753-96-1813. Parade Street
formed part of the old French road to Fort Le Boeuf, French garrison,
1753-59; English 1760-63, and in 1785 American 1795-1806, also 1812-13.
Here in 1763 took place the hard fought two days’ battle of Presque
Isle, with Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas, who, with a vast force,
simultaneously attacked all thirteen forts, and captured nine of them,
including Presque Isle and Le Boeuf, and again this was the objective
point of the Indians in 1794, when they were finally conquered by
General Wayne.

Here Thomas Rees, first justice of peace, entertained in his tent at the
mouth of Mill Creek, a French exile, the Duke de Chartres, subsequently
Louis Philippe, king of France. At the foot of Peach and of Cascade
Streets, granite blocks, with brass markers, note approximate positions
where Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry’s ships were built, on which he won
the victory of the “Battle of Lake Erie,” in 1813. The powder used to
fight that battle was made at Du Pont’s, Wilmington, Delaware, and
brought through Pennsylvania in Conestoga wagons. The second flagship of
his fleet, the _Niagara_, is in Erie Harbor, having been raised from the
sand of Misery Bay, where it lay for nearly a century; it was rebuilt by
the state at a cost of $75,000 for the Perry Centennial in 1913; the
first flagship, _Lawrence_, was raised and rebuilt for the Centennial
Exposition in Philadelphia, in 1876; also in Erie harbor is the United
States warship _Michigan_, now named _Wolverine_ and used as a naval
militia training ship; built in 1844, it was the first iron warship, and
brought to Erie in sections from Pittsburgh; the original engine is
still intact and seaworthy; now oldest ironclad vessel in the world.

At foot of French Street, Commodore Perry’s fleet landed with the
captured British squadron. This place was camping ground of the
Pennsylvania militia; in War of 1812-13, the British fleet was drawn up
in front of the harbor, to destroy Perry’s vessels while under
construction; Captain Daniel Dobbins of Erie, commander of the _Ohio_,
was the guiding spirit in building the fleet; 2500 soldiers encamped
here, with cannon mounted, and such military preparedness as to forebode
disaster to an enemy attempting entrance to the harbor. General
Lafayette visited Erie in 1825, and a banquet was given him.

The Presque Isle peninsula, surrounding Erie harbor, has a state park,
of more than 1500 acres, which is free to all; it gives Erie a large and
thoroughly protected harbor; 100 acres were reserved for United States
fortifications and dockyards; a life-saving station here, established in
1876, is place of interest. Presque Isle Bay is the finest natural
harbor on the Great Lakes, four and one-half miles long, one and
one-half miles wide. Lakeside Park, an irregular and sloping strip of
land along the water front, from Mill Creek on east, to City line west,
sixty-five acres, was laid out in 1888 by John L. Cully, landscape
engineer; other open spaces are the Waterworks Park; the Reservoir;
Erie, Trinty and Lakeside Cemeteries. Present city planner is John
Nolan, of Massachusetts. Erie has also twenty smaller parks, of these
the largest are Glenwood, between Sassafras and Cherry Streets,
purchased by Erie Public Park Association in 1903, 114 acres, a natural
forest with large stream of clear water and swimming pool; the Fish
Hatchery, Twenty-third and Sassafras Streets, one of the most important
in the state; Waldamere, four miles west on Lake Erie, and the State
Normal School Grounds at Edinboro, sixteen miles south of Erie.

VENANGO COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800, territory then recently acquired by treaties from
the Indians, named from In-nan-ga-eh (a rude figure cut in a tree),
Seneca language. A well-watered country, the Allegheny River meandering
through rugged hills, about 400 feet high, presents places of rare
scenic grandeur; into it flow several streams of considerable volume,
among them Oil Creek, French Creek, and Big Sandy. For a number of years
after the discovery of petroleum, in 1859, it continued to be the
principal oil-producing field; now chief industries are manufacturing,
refining of petroleum, lumbering, and agriculture.

FRANKLIN, county seat, population 9970, named for Benjamin Franklin, was
laid out by William Irvine and Andrew Ellicott, state commissioners, in
1795, on a plateau where a few Seneca Indians were living in comparative
security, with a lookout on the highest point of the highest hill,
giving views up and down the two beautiful rivers. Being a conservative
town, the original city plan has been closely followed, descendants of
the early white settlers are living on their own lands from original
surveys. Courthouse, Renaissance, brick, in center of a fine wide park,
contains portrait of John Morrison, first town crier; near by is
Soldiers’ Monument, marble shaft surmounted by an eagle; on the pedestal
are carved names of Venango County soldiers killed in the Civil War;
opposite is the _Franklin News_ office, Renaissance, good modern
construction.

[Illustration: VENANGO COUNTY]

St. John’s Protestant Episcopal Church has fine Tiffany windows; the
Presbyterian, Baptist, and Roman Catholic churches all have good
architecture and stained glass windows. Fine Armory Building. Original
lock and dam are preserved intact, in an early canal extended to
Franklin, from the “Feeder” Canal several miles below Meadville, on
French Creek, its course is plainly seen at many places along the creek;
five old bridges that were swept away by fire and ice have been replaced
by modern structures; one is called the “Washington,” concrete, handsome
design.

Three early frontier forts were here, sites marked by monuments and
tablets, Fort Machault, French, Elk Street near Sixth Street, 1753-59;
Washington came here on way to Fort Le Boeuf, 1753; this fort had a
share in the maneuvers that precipitated “the great seven years war” and
dissipated the dreams of an extended French empire; the expedition which
brought on actual hostilities was organized and received its impetus at
Fort Machault. French troops passed through, and often a thousand
Indians lingered here. Fort Venango, Elk Street at Eighth Street,
English, 1760-63, captured and burned by the Indians during Pontiac’s
war; and Fort Franklin, on Franklin Avenue west of Thirteenth Street,
built by United States 1787-96, later abandoned; also the Old Garrison,
on bank of French Creek near junction with Allegheny River, erected by
the United States after Fort Franklin. This city has never failed in a
military crisis; during the war of 1848, George C. McClellan led the
“forlorn hope” which captured the fortified buildings at Chepultepec,
making the taking of the palace possible.

Six miles down the river is “Indian God Rock,” on which are still seen
Indian picture writings; near this rock, Celeron, a Frenchman, under
orders from the governor of Canada, is said to have buried one of the
engraved leaden plates, placed at various points from Lake Erie to the
Mississippi River, as marks of renewal of French possession. Opposite is
a bald mountain, from which are fine views of river scenery; among the
hills are numerous caves and ravines, a lovely ravine is Glen Fern south
of Franklin; Monarch Park, halfway to Oil City, is a well-equipped
pleasure ground. OIL CITY, on Oil Creek, population 21,274, so named
because it was the center of the oil industry after discovery of
petroleum in 1859. In early days, “Seneca Oil” was obtained from the
Indians, who gathered it by spreading their blankets in Oil Creek, the
surface of which was covered with oil.

Hasson Park, with forty acres of natural wooded area, has rustic, stone,
arch gateway at Bissell Avenue entrance. In Christ Protestant Episcopal
Church are memorial windows by Lamb, New York. United States Post Office
at the corner of Seneca and Clifford Streets, built by the Government in
1906, Romanesque, gray brick and stone. Carnegie Library, built, 1904,
modified Romanesque, gray brick and stone; architect, Charles D. Bollon,
Philadelphia. Five bridges over the Allegheny River include the original
suspension bridge and “The Petroleum,” said to be finest in strength and
dimension north of Pittsburgh; in 1892 a large petroleum tank caught
fire and burning oil spread over the water in the creek, it also set
fire to the buildings, and many lives were lost. From Franklin and Oil
City, public highways, now under state control, lead along streams and
over uplands of great beauty.

[Illustration: IRON FURNACE--OIL CITY AND VICINITY

When the iron and steel industry started, iron furnaces such as the
above were built near deposits of bog ore, and the product shipped by
the river to Pittsburgh long before railroads arrived or cities
appeared]

WARREN COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800; named for General Joseph Warren, who fell at the
Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775; land is varied, with mountains, plains,
and narrow valleys; the Allegheny River flows through, with tributaries
large enough for floating rafts or propelling machinery. The beautiful
Kinzua Hills, east, are nearly 2200 feet above tidewater, over them is
the famous Kinzua Viaduct, said to be the highest in the world. Early
industries were lumber and oil, now they are chiefly agriculture and
manufacturing.

WARREN, made county seat in 1819, was first laid out by General William
Irving and Andrew Elliott, state commissioners in 1795; population
14,272; in 1800, first sawmill in the county was started which is said
to have made the first raft of lumber ever floated down the Allegheny;
it also sawed lumber in 1805 for Jackson’s Tavern, in which George W.
Fenton, afterwards governor of New York, in 1806, taught school, until
the schoolhouse of round logs with openings covered by oiled paper for
windows, was ready. Courthouse, built, 1825, was first brick building in
the county. A suspension bridge crosses the Allegheny here, built about
1871; near entrance to bridge is the Soldiers’ Monument, granite,
erected in 1909, on which are inscribed the battles of Warren County men
in Civil War. Bronze monument to General Warren and his soldiers is in
the west park, dedicated, 1910, placed by the

[Illustration: WARREN COUNTY]

Joseph Warren Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution. Memorial
Library, classic, Doric; architect, Wetmore, New York, is on site of
residence of Francis Henry, Esq.

TIDIOUTE, population 1065, in midst of most picturesque surroundings,
hills 500 to 700 feet high, covered thickly with forests, where the
Allegheny River makes a beautiful curve, crossed here by a suspension
bridge built between 1860-70, was famous as an oil-producing community,
and the center of a large and excited population, now a quiet residence
of wealth and refinement. Also on banks of the Allegheny is the
Cornplanter Reservation, given to the great Seneca chief and his heirs
for ever, as a reward for military service and influence during the War
of 1812; in 1866, the State Legislature authorized the erection of a
monument here, inscription, “Gyantwahia, The Cornplanter, Died at
Cornplanter Town, Feb. 18, 1836, aged about 100 years.”

[Illustration: BUTLER COUNTY]




XXXIII

BUTLER COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800; named in honor of General Richard Butler, born in
York County; natural scenery is varied, with hills, knolls, and ridges,
intervening valleys and broad, fertile fields, while many streams dash
over rocky bottoms in all directions and flash their clear waters in the
sunlight. The county is rich in old traditions. In 1753, Washington
passed through over the Indian trail extending from site of Pittsburgh
to Franklin, Venango County; Lafayette stopped here overnight, and many
stories of hairbreadth escapes from Indians are related, among them that
of Massy Harbison and her baby, who after seeing two of her children
killed and scalped, almost starved for days, but finally escaped; the
descendants of that baby still reside in the county. Robert Morris owned
about 100,000 acres of land in this region. Chief industries, notably
its large output of oil and gas, also manufactories; the Standard Steel
Car Works, one of the largest plants in the United States, and the
Standard Plate Glass Works.

BUTLER, county seat, population 23,778; laid out in 1803; rectangular,
sheltered on all sides by hills; on the top of a small knoll is the
public square, with fountain, walks, grass plots, and flower beds; it
contains the Soldiers’ Monument, dedicated in 1894 to “Our Silent
Defenders”; facing the park is the Courthouse, Gothic French style, with
a high tower, stone, built in 1885; architect, James P. Bailey,
Pittsburgh; remodeled in 1908 by J. C. Fulton, of Uniontown; interior
has mural paintings, representing historic scenes in Butler County; the
Woman’s Club furnished a rest room for women here in the basement. Two
interurban street railway lines from Pittsburgh have their terminus near
this point. Within two squares is the Post Office, built, 1914, Grecian;
light brick with granite Ionic columns; architect, Oscar Wenderoth.
Opposite is St. Paul’s Roman Catholic Church, English-Gothic, with stone
tower 180 feet high; constructed of beautifully colored local sandstone
in the rough, trimmed with the same stone dressed smooth; roof,
variegated shingle tile; architect, John T. Comes, Pittsburgh; interior
has mural decorations by the Christian Art Guild; the altars are known
as “Tryptich,” said to be the only ones of their kind in America; the
sanctuary is considered among the richest and most complete in this
country; stained glass windows from George Boos, Munich, Bavaria. St.
Peter’s German Catholic Church has stained glass windows from Munich,
made by Meyer & Company, who also made windows for St. Peter’s
Protestant Episcopal Church.

The county has numerous fine, concrete bridges; Butler Viaduct is the
largest, 1060 feet between the approaches connecting East Wayne Street
with Center Avenue across a deep ravine, built in 1915 by the Fort Pitt
Bridge Works. Two miles northeast of town is a pleasure park of natural
beauty in a wooded valley, well equipped with dining rooms, ball
grounds, lake for boating, etc. Five miles from Butler on the heights
above Herman Station is ST. MARY’S MONASTERY, Gothic, built by the
Capuchin Fathers, of which St. Fiedelis College forms a part. SAXONBURG
was laid out in 1832 by John Roebling, here he lived and manufactured
the first wire cable, which he used in constructing suspension bridges
that made him famous, notably the Brooklyn Bridge across East River, New
York. At EVANS CITY, on a grassy knoll in the cemetery, is the Soldiers’
Monument; Quincy granite shaft, surmounted by an eagle standing on a
globe, the names of forty-five soldiers are inscribed on it; dedicated,
1894.

On the same road is HARMONY, an old historic settlement, founded by
George Rapp of Germany; who organized a society known as Harmonites,
they purchased 5000 acres of best farm land along the Connoquenessing
Creek, amid beautiful scenery, and formed a communistic colony; all
money and goods went into a common fund; all worked together in harmony
and concord; the quaint old cemetery is surrounded by a wall four feet
thick; at the entrance is a gate consisting of one large stone which
turns on a pivot; more than one hundred of the sect are buried here;
high up on the bank, above the creek, is a curious stone formation
called “Rapp’s Seat,” here, tradition relates, “Father Rapp” used to sit
and oversee the work carried on by the community; the tourist is well
repaid for the climb by the beautiful view from that high point. Another
historic place is known as the “Old Stone House” on Mercer Turnpike, ten
miles north of Butler, used as a tavern in the eighteenth century; here
in 1843, an Indian named “Mohawk” killed Mrs. Wigton and her four
children.

A State Normal School with fine large buildings and wide, shady campus
is at SLIPPERY ROCK. About 1792, numerous depredations by Indians were
quieted for some time by General Brodhead’s expedition to the head
waters of the Allegheny River with Captain Samuel Brady’s help, a
notable Indian fighter; his leap of 23 feet over the waters at Slippery
Rock, 20 feet deep, with Indians back and front, gained the praise of
the Indian chief, who said, “Blady make good jump.” At WEST SUNBURY an
agricultural school has lately been established.

XXXIV

MERCER COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800; named for General Hugh Mercer of the
Revolutionary War, who was killed in the Battle of Princeton; rolling
land, well watered with springs and creeks; coal underlying one-fourth
of land in the county; chief industries are iron, steel, and
agriculture; early settlers were Scotch-Irish. In 1812, Mercer County
people were frequently called upon to aid in defense of Erie; the whole
county would be aroused in a day by runners; in a few hours most of the
men, whether militia or volunteers, would be on the march; one call came
on Sunday, while service was being held in the courthouse; the sermon
was suspended, news announced, benediction given, and immediate
preparation for march commenced; at another time, news of threatened
invasion came in the middle of grain harvest; the response was
immediate, only one old man was left in the town.

MERCER, county seat, population 1932; was once an Indian village of
seventy lodges; no settlement was made here until after Wayne’s victory
over the Indians in 1795; it was laid out in 1803, on two hundred acres
of land given by John Hoge of Washington County. The courthouse, built,
1909, colonial; brick, stone, and concrete; is in center of the public
square of three acres; interior finished in white marble; mural painting
in dome by Edward Everett Simmons, represents Power, Innocence, Guilt,
and Justice; in the courtrooms

[Illustration: MERCER COUNTY]

[Illustration: MURAL PAINTING IN THE DOME OF MERCER COUNTY COURT HOUSE

_Painted by Edward Everett Simmons_]

on second floor are symbolic mural paintings, “Criminal Law,” by Vincent
Aderente, and “Civil Law,” by Arthur Foringer, made in 1911; panels 11
by 12 feet; in the judges’ chambers is a portrait of Honorable Henry
Baldwin, former member of the Mercer County bar, and Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, 1830-44. On courthouse grounds is
the monument, granite and bronze, to soldiers of Mercer County in the
war of 1861-65.

The Humes Hotel, at the northeast corner of the Public Square, built,
1817, then known as “The Hackney House,” oldest hostelry in the county,
had as guests Marquis de Lafayette in 1824; his room, No. 12, is open to
guests; President Taylor and Buchanan, and General John B. Gordon of
Georgia also visited here. The celebrated Harthegig healing springs,
named after an Indian chief, is near Mercer; Indians claimed it healed
them of many diseases. HOPE MILLS was the birthplace and the early home
of George Junkin, D.D., who was father-in-law of General Stonewall
Jackson; his father was a captain in the War of 1812. GROVE CITY is a
picturesque college town, being the home of Grove City College, founded
by Dr. Isaac C. Kettler. Buhl farm, near SHARON, is a recreation park
for citizens of Shenango Valley and has club house, swimming pool, golf,
tennis, and baseball grounds.

[Illustration: ARMSTRONG COUNTY]




XXXV

ARMSTRONG COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1800, and named for General John Armstrong, who
commanded the expedition against the Indians at Kittanning in 1756, and
destroyed their town; a hilly and well-watered region with fine farming
lands on bottoms and hills. Bituminous coal and limestone are found in
all parts of the county; cannel coal of excellent quality, oil, gas, and
iron ore; the plate-glass industry at Ford City is said to be the
largest in the world. Historic places are, site of Fort Jacob; Battle of
Blanket Hill; and point where Washington and Gist crossed the river, not
marked.

KITTANNING, county seat, settled in 1804; population 7153; on site of an
Indian village of same name; later it was one of the French and Indian
forts, extending via Venango and Fort Le Boeuf to Erie. An Indian trail
left Horse Shoe Bend at Kittanning Point, Blair County, and came through
Cambria County to Cherry Tree, Canoe Point, Indiana County, crossing
from there to Kittanning. The courthouse, jail, and sheriff’s house are
built together, of fine cut stone from Catfish Quarry, Clarion County,
cupola, 108 feet from the ground, foundations, 7 feet wide, sunk in
solid rock 24 feet below the surface; architect, James McCullough, Jr.,
Kittanning, built, 1870-73.

At MAHONING, in 1780, was a fierce encounter with the Indians by General
Brodhead, commander of Fort Pitt, and Captain Samuel Brady, and another
encounter at Brady’s Bend. Captain Brady fought in the Revolution, at
siege of Boston, in the massacre at Paoli, and in 1779 was ordered to
Fort Pitt. FORD CITY, population 5605, has statue of Colonel J. B. Ford,
father of plate-glass industry. Several fine churches are here.




XXXVI

INDIANA COUNTY


Formed March 30, 1803. Named for Indians; early settlers, mostly
Scotch-Irish, who not only had the Indians to contend with, but also
venomous reptiles and beasts of prey, with which the country abounded;
near the cabin door one would hear the quick snap of the viselike jaws
of the wolf, one could see the panther crouching in a tree, or the
catamount glaring from a thicket. Chief industries, agriculture and coal
mining; entire county is underlaid with bituminous coal of finest
quality; glass and brick-making are important; electricity and natural
gas solve the heating and lighting problems.

INDIANA, county seat, laid out in 1805; population 7043; courthouse, in
center of town, brick and gray stone, Renaissance, built, 1871, jail in
same style joins it, built, 1888. Town hall, brick with Cleveland
limestone trimmings, Renaissance, built, 1913, architect, H. King
Conklin, Newark, New Jersey. Savings and Trust Company, white brick,
Renaissance. Presbyterian Church, semi-Gothic, Hummelstone, has fine
windows, one by Dodge, New York, formerly with Tiffany. United
Presbyterian Church, Moorish, brick, built, 1851. State Normal School,
northeast of town on high ground beautifully kept, buildings all of
stone or brick, modern school construction, contains good reproductions
of famous paintings and replicas of celebrated sculpture, distributed
throughout the

buildings as a decorative and educational element; portrait of Jane E.
Leonard, principal since opening in 1875, artist, H. S. Stevenson,
Pittsburgh, was given by the alumni; and interesting class windows in
Leonard Hall, given by three separate graduate classes, makers, Rudy
Brothers, Pittsburgh; near the borough is Devil’s Elbow, one of nature’s
beauty spots.

Armstrong Spring, an old Indian camping ground, on Indian Trail,
“Kittanning Path,” which passed north of the Rice Hill, west to this
spring, in private property, and through normal school grounds to
Kittanning, Armstrong County; over this trail Lieut. Colonel John
Armstrong was sent with seven companies against Indians, at the battle
of Blanket Hill, Kittanning, in 1756. Two miles west on Kittanning Pike
is site of Clark’s blockhouse, first building in the county, the spring
and part of old stone fort are still there, not marked.

CHERRY TREE, on Susquehanna River prominent point on old purchase line,
in treaty of William Penn with the Indians at Fort Stanwix, 1768, also
called “Canoe Point”; from here, the Indians carried their canoes to the
Allegheny River at Kittanning, sixty miles away; a direct line between
these two points formed part of the boundary of lands acquired from the
Six Nations. Where original Cherry Tree stood is the meeting point of
Indiana, Cambria, and Clearfield counties, monument erected by county
commissioners; designed by E. F. Carr & Company, Quincy, Massachusetts,
unveiled 1894; Governor Beaver made the address; inscription, “This
monument is erected to mark Canoe Place, the corner of the Proprietaries
Purchase from the Indians by Treaty at Fort Stanwix, New York, November
5, 1768.” In the southeast is a tunnel, part of old portage railroad
through spur of Alleghenies, where the Conemaugh makes a bend of two and
one-half miles. Near are Aurora Falls, for sixty feet over rock and
through a picturesque gorge to the Conemaugh River (Kiskiminetas) which
forms southern boundary, tributary streams fall twenty to thirty feet to
the mile.

Near ARMAGH is the old Buena Vista Furnace, one of three operated in
southeast section in the early forties, relic of the early iron industry
when ore was taken from the hills, melted into pig metal, and
transported to the markets over the old Pennsylvania Canal. BLAIRSVILLE,
on proposed William Penn highway, settled, 1819, population 4391, named
for John Blair of Blair’s Gap. First United Presbyterian Church, Tudor
Gothic. LUZERNE is said to have largest electrically equipped coal
(bituminous) operations in the world, and develops power to other
operations within a radius of twenty-five miles. SALTZBURG, settled in
1817 by Andrew Boggs, is near site of an Indian village, beautiful Kiski
Falls are here; several wells producing salt of excellent quality were
put down from 1813 and later. ELDER’S RIDGE, academy, stone, built in
1816, was the first state vocational school in Pennsylvania. The
underground railway was in active operation in Indiana County during the
latter days of slavery.




XXXVII

CAMBRIA COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1804; named by early Welsh settlers for the Cambria
Hills in Wales; has been called the Switzerland of America. Here are
many places of historic and scenic interest. The old Kittanning Trail
crossed the country in the north through Ashville, where there is an
Indian burial ground. Near Carrollton is Hart’s Sleeping Place; he was a
signer of the Declaration of Independence; the British made special
exertion to take him a prisoner, so he wandered through the woods,
sleeping in caves, being constantly hunted by the enemy. South is
LORETTO, a quaint old mountain town with one street, and an almost
entirely Roman Catholic community, founded by Prince Demetrius
Gallitzin, who brought a colony of settlers into the Allegheny Mountains
about 1796, and labored as a missionary in this district for forty
years; he died in 1840; the church he built here has been rebuilt in a
costly manner by Charles Schwab in honor of his birthplace. St. Francis
College has the tomb and monument of Prince Gallitzin in grounds.
Southeast is GALLITZIN at western end of a tunnel two-thirds of a mile
long on the Pennsylvania Railroad, 2160 feet above sea; a bronze statue
of the prince is here. PRINCE GALLITZIN SPRING, with a monument near by,
is along the State Highway near Summit, on top of the Alleghenies.

Beyond is CRESSON, a noted and beautiful summer

[Illustration: CAMBRIA COUNTY]

[Illustration: MONUMENT TO THE UNKNOWN DEAD OF THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD]

resort; here is Mount Aloysius Academy and the State Tuberculosis
Sanatorium No. 2. EBENSBURG, county seat, laid out in 1805; population
2179, is also a summer resort; through the woods and around the lakes of
this region the rhododendrons grow as tall as trees and are gorgeous in
their bloom. Descending along the upper waters of the Conemaugh,
numerous vestiges are seen of the old Portage Railroad, a series of
inclined planes, connecting the State Canal at Hollidaysburg east and
Johnstown on the west. Dickens wrote of the scenery along the canal,
“Sometimes the way wound through some lonely gorge like a mountain pass
in Scotland.” Many dams, which are really lakes, have been built by
manufacturers, the largest is three and one-half miles long, surrounded
by wooded hills with here and there a waterfall.

JOHNSTOWN, population 67,327, at confluence of the Conemaugh River and
Stony Creek, was founded in 1800 by a Swiss Mennonite, Joseph Schantz
(Johns). A glance at the deep, narrow valleys, with their high inclosing
walls, goes far to explain the possibility of so tremendous a
catastrophe as that which overwhelmed Johnstown on May 31, 1889.
Conemaugh Lake, two and one-half miles long, one and one-half miles
wide, was reserved as a fishing ground by a club of Pittsburgh
engineers, its waters were restrained by a dam 1000 feet long, built by
the state as a reservoir to store water for the state canal during the
dry seasons; a continuance of violent rains filled the lake to
overflowing; the break occurred at three o’clock in the afternoon, a gap
of 300 feet being formed at once. The water that burst through swept
down the valley in a mass one-half mile wide, forty feet high, carrying
everything in its way, completely destroying Johnstown and other towns
and villages in its track, going 18 miles in seven minutes, the distance
between Johnstown and the lake. The mass of houses, trees, machinery,
railway iron and human bodies was checked by the railway bridge below
Johnstown, which soon caught fire, probably burning to death hundreds of
persons imprisoned in the wreckage. About 2205 lives were lost; in the
Grandview Cemetery a large space is dedicated to the “Unidentified
Dead,” with a Westerly granite monument, having heroic size statues of
Faith, Hope, and Charity; sculptor, F. Barnicoat, Quincy, Massachusetts;
there are 778 individual markers for the bodies, largely unidentified,
laid out geometrically, so that from whatever angle the plot is seen,
they are in curved rows.

Johnstown was an important shipping station on the canal connecting
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. An interesting feature now remaining is the
canal tunnel at bend of the Conemaugh, four miles east of Johnstown;
second such tunnel built in America; constructed by the state about 1828
or 1830; the first is in Lebanon County, made in 1827. The Carnegie
Library received by bequest from James M. Swank, historian and iron and
steel statistician, his books and historical relics. Franklin Street
Methodist Episcopal Church, Gothic, gray sandstone; the sills under the
windows of the auditorium are dressed stones from the abandoned
Pennsylvania Canal Locks, near site of the present Pennsylvania Railroad
station; architect, George Fritz. First Presbyterian Church, at the
corner of Walnut and Lincoln Streets, dedicated, 1913; modified English

[Illustration: THE GAP BELOW JOHNSTOWN]

Gothic, Cleveland gray sandstone and green tile, architects, Badgley &
Nicholas, Cleveland.

The Cambria Steel Company began in 1840, when George S. King and David
Stewart discovered a vein of iron ore about fifteen inches thick, on the
Laurel Run, west of Johnstown; they built the first blast furnace in
Cambria County in 1842, calling it the Cambria Furnace; in 1843 Dr.
Peter Shoenberger bought out David Stewart’s interest; he was the great
ironmaster of his time, conducting a chain of furnaces, forges and
rolling mills, stretching almost 500 miles, from the old Marietta
furnace in Lancaster to the Wheeling, West Virginia, iron works. The
Cambria Iron Works were completed in 1853, and sold to a syndicate of
Philadelphians who selected Matthew Newkirk as president; in 1854 they
rolled the first iron rails; the first steel rails in America were
rolled here in 1867 from blooms imported from England. Iron is the
county’s chief industry.

[Illustration: CLEARFIELD COUNTY]




XXXVIII

CLEARFIELD COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1804; named by the first settlers from a cleared field
in the forest made by the Indians, site of “Chingleclamouche’s old
Town,” said to have been the most considerable Indian village on the
upper West Branch of the Susquehanna, now Clearfield Borough. The whole
county is a continuous prospect of intensely picturesque scenery;
surface mountainous, with ranges broken into innumerable, irregular
spurs, indented by streams; from many hilltops views of the greater part
of the county may be seen; the “Knobs,” its loftiest summit, is
constantly in view, and the intermediate country, a panorama of natural
beauty, ever changing in atmospheric effects; all the creeks,
tributaries of the West Branch of the Susquehanna, have scenery which
beggars description, a veritable feast for the painter, poet, and
romancer; Moshannon and Clearfield Creeks had their beaver dams.

Up Anderson’s Creek, on the old Milesburg and Le Boeuf road, opened
prior to 1802, a detachment of regulars marched against the British at
Lake Erie in the War of 1812. Important Indian trails traversed this
county, crossing the head waters of Clearfield Creek, Chest Creek, near
“Hart’s Sleeping Place,” and the West Branch at Canoe Place. Another ran
from Bald Eagle Creek where Marsh Creek empties, in Blair County, going
west crossed Moshannon and Clearfield Creeks to Chingleclamouche; this
was also called the Trader’s Path; none of the present roads are made
upon the Indian trails. A mortar-shaped stone has been located about
five miles east of Clearfield, on the State Highway, and has been marked
by local Daughters of the American Revolution as site of an Indian mill
for grinding corn.

Early settlers were mostly from older Eastern counties; these were
followed by Germans, Irish, Scotch-Irish, and French. Chief industry,
the mining of bituminous coal. In 1828 Peter Karthaus arrived in
Harrisburg with six arks, laden with bituminous coal from his mines in
this county, it was exhibited in front of the Capitol; not until about
1870 did the industry begin to assume any great magnitude; today the
yearly output aggregates millions of tons, and the lower measures are
not yet developed. Peter Karthaus also started the iron industry, near
KARTHAUS, but it was short-lived; here, it is said, the first successful
attempt was made in Pennsylvania to smelt iron by means of bituminous
coal. Other important industries are vitrified brick, drain tile, and
tanning.

CLEARFIELD, county seat; population 8529; on land owned by Abraham
Witmer, laid out, 1805, in regular squares like Philadelphia; streets
running east and west are named, those north and south numbered. Two
small parks were reserved along the West Branch. Principal buildings are
scattered. Courthouse, brick, Romanesque, built in 1860, architects,
Cleveland & Bachus, contains portraits of former judges, among them
Honorable John Holden Orvis; it is located in center of the original
plan of the borough. Near are most of the churches, of which the
Trinity Methodist Episcopal, Romanesque, and St. Francis’ Roman
Catholic, Gothic, may be mentioned for architecture. The high school is
well lighted and of best school construction; each of the principal
towns of this county has its high school. Prominent men of Clearfield
were, Honorable William Bigler, State Governor, and Honorable William A.
Wallace, United States Senator; they are buried in Hillcrest Cemetery; a
monument to Governor Bigler was erected by the state.

XXXIX

TIOGA COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1804; name, corruption of the Iroquois word “Tiagoa”
(gateway); noted for its high altitude and wonderful views; part of
Allegheny plateau, where it breaks into parallel flat-topped mountains,
supporting, in shallow basins, several isolated bituminous coal fields.
Heritage of timber is being dissipated; the State Tree Nursery at Asaph
is trying to replace the great waste. Chief industry, agriculture, land
for dairy purposes is among the finest in the state, several extensive
milk condenseries. Indian trails crossed the county from Big Tree on the
Genesee, among the Senecas, to the frontier at Northumberland. First
great road was built by Charles Williamson of New York in 1792, agent
for Sir William Poulteney, who had received a large grant of land in New
York State, adjoining Pennsylvania, in the “Genesee Country,” home of
the Seneca Indians; the road, commencing at Loyalsock, passed through
what is now Williamsport, up Lycoming Creek to Trout Run, over Laurel
Hill to “Block House,” now Liberty; here Williamson built a blockhouse
of logs 20 by 40 feet, as place of refuge; to Peter’s Camp, now
Blossburg, where coal was discovered in 1792; ending near Bath, New
York, it opened up to settlers 15,000,000 acres of land in Pennsylvania
north of Williamsport; this road is still used from Williamsport to
Tioga County.

County seat, WELLSBORO, population 3452, named for William Hill Wells,
United States Senator 1799-1814, laid out March 21, 1806, in a primeval
wilderness. Courthouse, center of group of county buildings facing the
public green, colonial with cupola, built in 1835, native sandstone and
conglomerate, which was hauled on ox sleds for several miles over poor
roads; high on the southwest wall is carved the outline of an eagle,
insignia of one of the stonecutters from the neighboring Welsh
settlement. Opposite, across the green, is the brick office of the
Bingham Estate, built in 1855, and still occupied by the agent, patent
of 1,000,000 acres, land mostly in northern tier, included site of
Binghamton, New York. William Bingham, lived 1751-1804, was a
Philadelphia merchant, member of Continental Congress, and of the United
States Senate. Facing the courthouse is a Soldiers’ Monument to Civil
War heroes, dedicated, 1886; also on the green is a monument to the late
John Magee, who developed the coal fields and railroads of the county, a
colossal portrait bust on polished granite pedestal; sculptor, Samuel
Conkey, New York.

Best modern buildings are, The Presbyterian Church, Gothic, Ohio
sandstone, erected in 1894, architects, Culver & Hudson, Williamsport,
contains, among memorial windows, one to George Dwight Smith, killed in
the battle of Smith Mountain; also Tiffany tablet to Mrs. A. C. Shaw,
white marble, framed in mosaic of favrile glass. St. Paul’s Protestant
Episcopal Church, fronting the green, is a choice example of Norman
Romanesque, the last ecclesiastical work of the late Halsey Wood, New
York, built in 1897,

[Illustration: ANTIQUE CAPITAL, CHESTER PLACE, WELLSBORO

native sandstone, windows furnished by Tiffany, are quiet and pleasing
in tone, of unusual harmony with the masonry; pulpit and altar are also
from the Tiffany studios; the church contains many fine memorials. St.
Peter’s Roman Catholic Church was remodeled from the old academy,
locally an important and historic institution; standing on a hill the
church raises aloft a gilded cross, impressive and beautiful above the
surrounding foliage.

The broad main street is paved with brick, around a central strip of
green grass, and shaded with fine old elms and maples. The Wellsboro
Cemetery, purchased in 1855, was laid out by B. F. Hathaway, landscape
gardener, of Flushing, Long Island; stone arch gateway, Romanesque, of
local conglomerate, is memorial to Honorable Henry Warren Williams,
Justice of Supreme Court, buried here; architect, J. H. Considine,
Elmira; on summit of the knoll is the grave of George W. Sears, poet of
outdoor life and wood lore, monument has bas-relief bronze portrait, set
in granite; Honorable John J. Mitchell, Judge of Pennsylvania Supreme
Court and United States Senator, is also buried here. Woodland Park,
twenty-six acres, is owned by Leonard Harrison, Esq., who generously
maintains it for public use; has surface of hill and dell, stretches of
natural forest, and fine views from its higher outlooks.

Several citizens have grounds formally laid out, and planted under
professional advice; of these, designed by Bryant Fleming, of Townsend &
Fleming, Buffalo, is Chester Place, left to the borough by bequest, for
a public library; the garden has an Italian roofed pergola ending with
a marble bust and seats, on top of the terrace which divides the upper
and lower gardens; a sundial, fastened to an old Spanish Renaissance
capital, which came from the collection of garden marbles made by the
late Stanford White, is on a rectangular plot of green, and forms the
center of one garden room, surrounded by a brick walk, in turn framed by
a broad border of shrubbery; into the brick pavement are set little
marble panels, carved with designs of roses, birds, etc., other insets
contain quotations appropriate to gardens; set into the wall outside at
right and left of entrance, are tiles with trees in bas-relief, inside,
correspondingly placed, are reliefs showing old Italian garden
decorations, Socrates and Hercules.

Just outside of Wellsboro is an old covered wooden bridge, in Pine Creek
Gorge, through which the Tyadaghton (River of Pines) runs, mountains
rise perpendicularly on either side for 1000 feet; the gorge is sixteen
miles long, filled with trout stream tributaries, where also bear, deer,
and other game abound.

In MANSFIELD is a state normal school, on beautifully terraced hill,
five buildings, brick with marble or brownstone and terra-cotta
trimmings, built 1889-1909, later buildings, modified classic; contains
many fine carbon prints of famous paintings and buildings, also plaster
replicas of noted pieces of sculpture. Carnegie Free Library, classic
architecture, built, 1912, light-pressed brick; architects for school
and library, Pierce & Bickford, Elmira, New York.




XL

McKEAN COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1804; named for Thomas McKean, second Governor of
Pennsylvania; mean altitude 1700 feet. Mount Jewett is one of the high
points in the state; half a mile from Mount Jewett is the great Kinzua
Viaduct on the Erie Railroad, said to be the highest bridge in the state
across a ravine. The electric line to Olean, New York, eighteen miles,
through Red Rock, reveals great scenic grandeur. Chief industry,
producing and refining petroleum.

SMETHPORT, county seat; was incorporated in 1807; population, 1568. In
the courthouse grounds is a granite monument to the Civil War soldiers
of this county; it was shown in the Centennial Exposition, Philadelphia.
St. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church, a gift from Hon. Henry Hamlin;
consecrated 1892; is pure fourteenth century English Gothic; architect,
Halsey Wood. Altar and reredos of Caen stone, surmounted by a very
beautiful, delicately carved canopy; memorial font, Caen stone; all
memorials were designed by the architect; organ from Johnson & Sons,
Westfield, Massachusetts. In the public school grounds is a tablet
marking the route of General Brodhead’s expedition. On the highway, near
Lafayette, is a tablet marking place where General Brodhead passed
across the county from Allegheny River, when he came from Pittsburgh
against the Indians; placed by Smethport Daughters of the American
Revolution.

BRADFORD, chief city; population, 15,525; is said to contain the only
plant in America for the manufacture

[Illustration: MCKEAN COUNTY]

[Illustration: KINZUA BRIDGE

The highest bridge in the world]

of oxalic acid, it produces 10,000 pounds daily. The City Hall, Post
Office, and Carnegie Library are fine buildings. The McKean County
Historical Society has rooms in the Carnegie Library; among their
collections are valuable historical papers and autographs, photographs,
and samples of products relating to the oil industry, portraits of
distinguished Pennsylvanians, and busts of General Kane and of Abraham
Lincoln; the latter, by Theophilus Mills, is said to be one of the only
two living masks ever made of Lincoln; it was made six weeks before the
assassination, and after many years it was purchased from the son of the
sculptor by Mr. R. B. Stone, and placed in the Bradford Library. The
Museum and Art Gallery, owned by Lewis Emery, Jr., Esq., is at times
open to the public. On the public square is a boulder, in honor of
Governor McKean, from a tract of land in Annin Township, deeded to
Thomas McKean by John Bull, a patriot of the Revolution. A tablet
commemorating the Spanish War soldiers was erected by Spanish War
veterans.

KANE, a beautiful mountain resort, has Evergreen Park, a native forest,
given to the town by the Erie Railroad, through their agent, General
Thomas L. Kane; a path through the forest is named for General Grant,
who frequently enjoyed trout fishing here with General Kane. Facing this
park is the high school; classic style, architects, Davis & Davis,
Philadelphia; contains good collection of photographic reproductions of
famous paintings and architecture. The Presbyterian Church is memorial
to General Kane, commander of the Bucktail Regiment, erected by his
family. At LEWIS RUN the great Indian hunter, Jim Jacobs, lived.

[Illustration: POTTER COUNTY]




XLI

POTTER COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1804; named for General James Potter, an officer of the
Revolution, is an almost trackless wilderness covered with dense growth
of pine and hemlock, the haunt of bear, deer, wolf, panther, fox, and
other wild game. Mean elevation is about 1900 feet above sea. At head
waters of the West Branch, Genesee and Allegheny rivers, in the north,
the ground is rolling, with beautiful farms; the southern part is broken
by deep valleys and lofty mountains, with most picturesque scenery,
especially in the Kettle Creek and Sinnemahoning valleys. Probably the
first white man to cross the county was David Zeisberger, who passed
down the Allegheny River to mouth of the Tionesta, Forest County, in
1767; his journal, now on file in the Moravian Library at Bethlehem,
tells of the wild beauty of the county. Farming and stock raising are
gaining, but the main industry is still lumbering, with second growth of
hardwoods, maple, beech, and birch, which will in time be a great
nucleus of wealth.

Earliest important road is the Jersey Shore Turnpike, running from
Jersey Shore at the mouth of Pine Creek, Lycoming County, through most
wonderful scenery to Coudersport and on to Buffalo; an effort is being
made to have this historic highway improved, as it is the most direct
way from the West Branch Valley to Buffalo. On this road is the site of
Oleona. Ole Bull, the famous violinist, attempted the settlement of a
colony of Norwegians; in 1852, he purchased 11,144 acres on Kettle
Creek, in the then almost unbroken forests; and laid out four villages,
New Norway, New Bergen, Oleona, and Walhalla; this proved a sad failure,
and the land is now included in the State Forest Reserve. Ole Bull’s
Castle, with a great stone wall, still partly standing, was built about
a mile below Oleona, on the crest of a bluff. Travel is generally good
in summer, during the winter the heavy snowdrifts are often too deep for
passage, temperature often falling to 40° below zero.

COUDERSPORT, county seat, settled in 1807; population 2836; courthouse,
substantial, colonial building in the square, on the main street; in the
grounds is the Soldiers’ Monument, a granite shaft, pedestal has names
of Potter County men who fell in war for the Union. The famous Bucktail
Regiment was recruited largely from Potter County, noted marksmen, many
had been famous hunters, and because of their wonderful skill with the
rifle were made sharpshooters in the Civil War. Christ Protestant
Episcopal Church, incorporated, 1833, present stone building, Gothic,
built in 1885, on ground given by Miss Katharine Dent. The beautiful
little church, “All Saints,” at Brookland, near the old Dent Homestead,
memorial to Henry Hatch Dent, by his children, maintained by endowment,
is native stone, with stained glass windows, marble memorial altar, and
other artistic furnishings, open by appointments of the Bishop, it
stands, as old “St. Martins-in-the-Field,” a solitary witness for
Christianity and the Church.

First Presbyterian, oldest church organization in

[Illustration: ON THE SINNEMAHONING CREEK]

Coudersport, established 1832, first building made in 1849, on ground
given by John Keating, Esq., present building, Fourth and Main Streets,
dedicated in 1903, Italian Renaissance; other denominations have good
church buildings. The Pennsylvania Historical Commission has made an
appropriation for the placing of a monument to David Ziesberger at
Coudersport; they will also place tablets at site of Ole Bull’s Castle
and near the Austin disaster; the Austin flood, in 1911, when the town
was almost blotted out, and many lives were lost and property destroyed,
was perhaps the worst calamity which has ever visited the county. Three
miles east of Coudersport is “The Sweden Valley Ice Mine,” in a shaft
about six feet square and twelve feet deep; during the hot summer
weather ice is formed here in large quantities; the Smithsonian
Institution has published a number of articles concerning these ice
caves.

[Illustration: JEFFERSON COUNTY]




XLII

JEFFERSON COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1804; named for Thomas Jefferson; steep and rugged
hills line the watercourses of every stream, alternating with fine
valley land, traversed by good roads through most picturesque scenery;
the views are a continual delight. In early days large tracts of this
land were held by rich proprietors who would neither improve nor sell at
a fair price. The pioneer hewed his canoes out of pine trees, large
enough to receive a barrel of flour crosswise; a homemade rope of flax
was attached to the front to pull them over the ripples. The county is
wonderfully rich in coal and an abundance of natural gas, and has
developed more along commercial than it has along artistic lines. Chief
industries: stock raising, coal, iron, glass, and silk.

County seat, BROOKVILLE, laid out in 1830; population 3272. Hunts Point,
now Carrier’s addition of Brookville, was once an Indian village. Main
Street runs east and west. Pickering Street crosses at right angles.
Courthouse, at the corner of Main and Pickering Streets; Renaissance,
brick; contains portraits. The Brookville Park Association is making
great civic improvements; a park of ten acres is in the center of the
town and a fine new park building or auditorium is being erected; the
organization being truly altruistic, to the intent that no dividends
shall be paid to the subscribers, but all profits applied to municipal
improvements. There are several churches, among them may be mentioned
the Presbyterian and Methodist for architecture; both Romanesque; stone.
The Presbyterian has good stained glass windows. The Daughters of the
American Revolution have placed a small monument to Joseph Barnett in
the old cemetery. Fort Barnett was one mile east of Brookville, on the
old turnpike (Mead’s Trail); his cabin in 1799 is said to have been the
only one within seventy-five miles.

PUNXSUTAWNEY, population 10,311, was an Indian village; during the
eighteenth century, Moravian missionaries labored here among the
Delaware tribes of the Algonquin Indians; Brother Ettewein kept a
faithful record of his travels and work, describing his journey along
Mahoning Creek, then named by the Indians “Mohulbucteetam,” or place
where canoes are abandoned. Rev. David Barkley and his son-in-law, Dr.
John W. Jenks, from Newtown, Bucks County, a graduate of the University
of Pennsylvania in 1816, later made an associate judge, owned the land
and laid out the town in 1820 in squares, including one for the public,
which in this century has been made into a beautiful park by Frederick
Olmstead, landscape gardener, of Brookline, Massachusetts; on each
corner are old cannon from the Civil War. A fine brick post office with
Ionic portico is here, built by the United States Government, and many
beautiful churches. Christ Episcopal Church is built with stone taken
from the creek bed and laid without any cutting; the soft brown color
was caused by the mineral in the water, and is permanent.




XLIII

SUSQUEHANNA COUNTY


Formed February 21, 1810; named for situation, at head waters of the
Susquehanna River, which completely drains the county, every stream
flowing into it as it flows around a spur of the Alleghenies with the
highest outline of two mountains; original Indian names, Onaquaga and
Miantinomah. The scenery is beautifully diversified; there are numerous
lakes, the largest, Crystal Lake, is over a mile long; from Elk
Mountain, with its three peaks, sixteen lakes are visible, and the Water
Gap is plainly seen on a clear day; from Ararat, 2040 feet above the sea
level, is also an extended view. A panorama of great beauty is seen from
the heights of Gibson Township; the slopes furnish unsurpassed grazing
and abound in orchards and gardens; named for Chief Justice Gibson, the
town was first settled in 1792 by Joseph Potter.

The most beautiful auto ride through the county is from Montrose to
SUSQUEHANNA, incorporated in 1853, called the City of Stairs; Erie
Railroad shops are here, the buildings, covering eight acres, include a
Library and Lecture Hall. Martin’s Creek Viaduct, 1600 feet long with
eleven spans, on the Lackawanna Railroad, is said to be, next to the
Tunkhannock Viaduct on same road, the largest concrete bridge in the
world; this road is known as the shortest route between New York and
Buffalo; owing to its high elevation through this county, the views are
of extraordinary

[Illustration: SUSQUEHANNA COUNTY]

beauty. Earliest white settlement was at Great Bend; General James
Clinton, with 1600 men, encamped here in 1799, _en route_ to join
General Sullivan at Chemung against the Indians. Chief industry,
agriculture and butter making.

MONTROSE, population 1661; made county seat in 1811, first settled by
Stephen Wilson of Vermont in 1799, is a notable health resort because of
its altitude; it was developed through the liberality of Dr. R. H. Rose
and Isaac Post, the latter was first postmaster in 1808. Dr. Rose
purchased 100,000 acres in 1807, partly in Silver Lake Township, and
developed the resources of the county. Public buildings face the square,
in which is the monument to Civil War soldiers. Courthouse, a fine
structure, colonial architecture, built in 1842, contains a portrait of
Honorable Galusha A. Grow, who was sent to Congress from this county.
The conference building seats 3000; here The Bible Institute is held
each summer. At SPRINGVILLE was farm of Zophar Blakeslee, whose
daughter, Sarah, was married to Honorable Asa Packer. BROOKLYN was early
residence of George Catlin, who became noted as a painter of Indians.
JACKSON started as a beaver meadow. When THOMSON was first settled, in
1820, an unbroken forest of beech wood stretched eastward for fifty
miles.

[Illustration: BRADFORD COUNTY]




XLIV

BRADFORD COUNTY


Formed February 21, 1810, as Ontario; on March 24, 1812, named in honor
of William Bradford, an attorney general in the cabinet of Washington;
surface hilly or rolling. Chief industries are dairying and breeding of
fine cattle and thoroughbred horses. Said to be first place on record
visited by a white man in Pennsylvania; in 1615 Stephen Bruhle, explorer
and interpreter for Samuel Champlain, with twelve Huron Indians, came to
Carouantian, a palisaded village of the Carouantiannais, on Spanish
Hill, just above present towns of Sayre and Athens; he found here 800
warriors, 500 of whom went with him to aid Champlain against the
Onondaga stronghold in New York. Bruhle returned to Carouantian,
remained during the winter of 1615-16, and explored the Susquehanna
River to the sea, making report to Champlain.

First road was the great Indian warpath along the Susquehanna, used by
General Sullivan and his Continental Army in expedition against the
Indians in 1779; the state road, from Wilkes-Barre, up the river,
through Wyoming and Bradford counties, is substantially on this old
trail; historic places along the road are well marked, a monument
thirteen feet high, native stone, from Campbell’s Ledge above Pittston;
erected by the Moravian Historical Society in 1871 near Wyalusing, marks
location of the Moravian mission, inscription, “To mark site of
Friedenshutten (Machwilusing), a settlement of Moravian Indians between
1765-1772”; this mission was removed to Beaver County in 1772. Farther
west, near the Presbyterian church, is a large boulder with bronze
tablet, inscription, “Near this site from August 5-8, 1779, camped the
army of Maj. Gen’l Sullivan, on their expedition against the Six
Nations, erected by Machwilusing Chapter, D. A. R. 1914”; this road
after leaving Wyalusing, leads over the hill a distance from the river,
to which it returns again at Rummerfield, near where Mrs. Roswell
Franklin was killed by Indians; her family was rescued.

Farther up the river is the county’s oldest historic landmark on west
bank of the Susquehanna, “Standing Stone,” 25 feet high, 21 feet at
base, tapers from 4 to 3 feet in thickness, rising out of the water; a
landmark even in early Indian history; plainly visible from the road;
General Sullivan’s army of 3500 men camped on the plain opposite; three
miles east of Towanda is Wysox village and creek, in front of an old
brick church is where Major Henry van Campen, with two other captives,
succeeded in releasing themselves, under guard by twice their number of
Indians, killing all except one. Near is a large boulder of Barclay
sandstone, with bronze tablet; inscription: “This stone commemorates the
passing through Wesauking, Aug. 9 and Oct. 4, 1779, of Maj. Gen’l John
Sullivan and his troops against the Six Nations. Erected, 1908, by the
George Clymer Chapter, D. A. R., Towanda, Pennsylvania”; on the level
plain between this creek and the river General Sullivan’s army camped.

From Wysox the road diverges west from the old trail, continues over a
modern steel bridge, built in 1915, replacing an old covered wooden one
made in 1834, to Towanda. Eight miles northwest is Ulster; passing on
the way: near mouth of Sugar Creek is site of an important palisaded
Indian village called “Ogehage,” later “Oscalui,” still later, in 1779,
“Newtychanning,” marked; at junction of this great warpath along the
Susquehanna, with one leading from this point to head waters of Towanda
Creek near Canton; thence to head waters of Lycoming Creek, down that
stream to West Branch of the Susquehanna near Williamsport. At Ulster
(old Sheshequin) was a Moravian mission, removed at time of migration to
Beaver in 1772; a steel bridge crosses the river here. Next is Milan
village, near which was Indian Queen Esther’s Town, destroyed by Colonel
Hartley in 1778.

Proceeding on General Sullivan’s road, one crosses the Chemung (Tioga)
River on a modern steel bridge and enters Athens, formerly Tioga Point;
here was Fort Sullivan, base of supplies for the army; destroyed by
themselves in October, 1779, on their departure for Wyoming; marked by
boulder with bronze tablet, inscription: “In Sullivan’s expedition, the
march that destroyed savagery and opened the Keystone and Empire States
to civilization, four brigades, furnished by the States of Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey, and New Hampshire, with Proctor’s Artillery, and
Farr’s Riflemen took part; at Tioga Point, long the southern door of the
Indian Confederacy, 5000 troops encamped; here stood Fort Sullivan, with
four blockhouses, from August 11 to October 3, 1779; tablet erected by
Tioga Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution.” Below the plate is
embedded a ball from one of General Sullivan’s guns; the road separates
here, one following the Susquehanna to Owego, the other following the
Chemung to Elmira (Newtown), New York; near the latter road is the
“Battlefield of Newtown,” where General Sullivan fought the Tories and
Indians in 1779.

A soldiers’ monument is on the campus in front of the old ATHENS
Academy, designed by McKim, Mead & White, New York; ground foundation
twenty-five feet square, inclosed in granite curbing with polished
globes at each corner; pedestal, eleven feet high, rising from the
center, polished granite, on unpolished granite coping, surmounted by a
bronze group, “The Protection of the Flag,” a barefoot drummer boy with
a flag over his shoulder and a tall, fearless soldier, holding a musket
which points to the ground, sculptor, George T. Brewster; inscription,
in bronze letters, fitted to the face of the granite: “_Pro patria et
gloria_. Erected to the memory of our soldiers who fought in defense of
the flag”; presented by Joseph Whipple and Charlotte Snell Stickler.
Spaulding Library and Museum, classic Renaissance with Ionic porch, open
to the public, contains paintings, portraits, and relics. In 1688 a
Spanish fort was near the present borough of Athens; population 4384.

TOWANDA, county seat, laid out in 1812; population 4269; courthouse
native sandstone, classic Renaissance, built in 1897; in front is the
soldiers’ monument, at base are bronze tablets inscribed with names of
battles of Bradford County men in war for the Union;

There are many borough and township high schools in Bradford County.

[Illustration: SCHUYLKILL COUNTY]




XLV

SCHUYLKILL COUNTY


Formed March 1, 1811, named for the Schuylkill River; was purchased from
the Six Nations in 1749. George Godfried Orwig, first settler, in 1747,
lived at Sculp Hill; he was followed by other Germans. ORWIGSBURG, first
county seat, in 1811, was founded in 1796, by Peter Orwig, son of
George; old courthouse still standing, is used as a factory; extensive
views from here of mountains and agricultural valleys. In chain of
frontier forts, were Franklin, built, 1756, by order of Benjamin
Franklin; Fort Henry, south of Pinegrove; and Fort Lebanon, later known
as Fort William, the most important, its site near Auburn, is marked by
boulder with bronze tablet, inscription, “On this site stood Fort
Lebanon, built, 1775, by Colonel Jacob Morgan, for protection of early
settlers against Indians, erected in 1913 by Mahantongo Chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolution, Pottsville, Pa.” Indian warriors
came down from the mountains and made savage forays on the peaceful
farms, in which many people were massacred, and mills and houses were
burned; the old oak tree is standing near, from which sentinels took
observations; in this fort the first religious services in the county
were held.

One mile from Fort Lebanon is the old Red Church, built in 1755,
destroyed by Indians, 1756, rebuilt, 1776, celebrated its
sesquicentennial in 1905. This county revels in picturesque scenery;
excellent roads curve through valleys of surpassing richness and
fertility, or wander along a ridge with glorious views on either side;
in the north, the sky line of a mountain range is often broken by a
weird coal breaker; in every direction there is beauty and interest.
Laurel may be seen by the acre, and much rhododendron. Great cliffs of
various colored conglomerate rock are found throughout the county.

This is the southern limit of the ANTHRACITE COAL fields in east central
Pennsylvania, the only ones of importance in the United States; divided
into three well-known trade regions, Wyoming; Lehigh; and Schuylkill;
comprising an area of 480 square miles, in the counties of Carbon,
Columbia, Lackawanna, Northumberland, Luzerne, Susquehanna, and
Schuylkill. Discovered in Schuylkill County by Nicho Allen in 1790;
while camping out overnight, he built a fire among some rocks, under
shelter of the trees; during the night, being awakened by unusual heat
he saw the rocks a mass of glowing fire, he having ignited the outcrop
of a bed of coal. The birth of this great productive industry may be
dated from 1820, when 365 tons were sent to Philadelphia from the head
waters of the Lehigh River. 80,000,000 tons per annum are now produced;
location of coal was shown in William Scull’s map of Pennsylvania
published in 1770; three places marked.

In 1795 it was used successfully for smithing by a blacksmith named
Whitestone, but not generally for this purpose until 1806. In 1812,
Colonel George Shoemaker produced coal from a shaft on land he owned,
now known as the Centreville Tract; loaded nine wagons and drove to
Philadelphia, where he was accused of being an impostor, attempting to
sell stone for coal; he sold two loads for cost of transportation, and
gave the rest away to those who promised to try to use it; he induced
Messrs. Mellon & Bishop to try it in their rolling mill in Delaware
County, where it was found to be a complete success; iron was heated in
much less time than usual, and the workmen said, “It passed through the
rolls like lead.”

From 1830, rapid improvements were made in methods of mining and
transporting coal. First breaker in this county was erected by Gideon
Bast on Wolf Creek, near Minersville. The St. Clair shaft was sunk in
1845, by Alfred Lawton, to Primrose vein, 122 feet; in 1851, E. W.
McGinness continued the depth of shaft to the Mammoth vein, 438 feet. At
Wadesville a shaft was sunk 619½ feet. A shaft located by General Henry
Pleasants is deepest coal shaft in the United States, 1584 feet. The
collieries of the Philadelphia & Reading Coal Company are the most
extensive. Property in Schuylkill and Columbia counties 18,333 acres,
one third coal, devised by Stephen Girard to the City of Philadelphia in
trust, comprises some of the most valuable tracts in the anthracite
region; Girard was largely instrumental in building the Schuylkill Canal
to Philadelphia, connecting with this was a railroad and a series of
gravity planes between Girardville and Mount Carbon, head of the canal;
the Girard Railroad, opened in 1834, was one of the greatest engineering
feats of the time, attracting international comment; much of the masonry
is still to be seen.

In 1690, William Penn called attention to the feasibility of passage by
water between the Susquehanna River and Tulpehocken Creek, a branch of
the Schuylkill; in 1762 David Rittenhouse and Dr. William Smith surveyed
a route for a canal, to connect waters of the Susquehanna and
Schuylkill, via Swatara and Tulpehocken Creeks; and actually traced a
line between the Delaware and Ohio Rivers at Fort Pitt, thence to Erie.
The Union Canal connecting the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers was
completed in 1826 by the Schuylkill Navigation Company; they did great
work in their day; years of greatest prosperity were from 1835-41.

In 1800, Reese & Thomas located an iron furnace on the site of
Pottsville. In 1807 Greenwood furnace and forge were erected by John
Pott. In 1839, Pioneer furnace at Pottsville, under Burd Patterson, was
blown in with anthracite coal, by Benjamin Perry, and ran for about
three months, among the first to use successfully anthracite coal in the
blast furnace in United States. POTTSVILLE, county seat, 1395 feet above
sea; population 21,876, laid out in 1816, has not one level street;
flights of steps are frequently used to get to various heights; fine
views from every point. A commission for city planning has lately been
appointed.

Courthouse erected in 1892, architect, Mr. Taylor, stands on a hill in a
terraced square, has portraits of judges; in the old courthouse, to the
rear, now torn down, the Mollie Maguires were tried and convicted in
1876. Soldiers’ Monument erected in 1891 is in Garfield Square, on a
pedestal are names of battles fought by Schuylkill County men in Civil
War; the Washington Artillery and National Light Infantry of Pottsville,
246 men, were part of the 530 Pennsylvanians

[Illustration: HENRY CLAY IRON MONUMENT, POTTSVILLE]

who first arrived at our national Capital for its defense in 1861;
Schuylkill County sent 13,000 volunteers; there are also soldiers’
monuments at Port Carbon, St. Clair, and Mahanoy City. A statue of John
Pott is in the playground of Center Street public school, formerly a
cemetery.

Pennsylvania, the coal-producing state of the Union, has every reason to
be grateful to Henry Clay for advocating a protective tariff on her
principal product; Pottsville’s enthusiasm culminated in the Henry Clay
Monument, completed in 1855, soon after his death, west of South Center
Street, an iron Doric column, surmounted by an iron statue of Henry
Clay, after the painting by P. F. Rothermel, “Senate of 1850”; first
colossal iron casting of its kind made in the United States; from
sidewalk to top of statue, 205 feet. Pottsville Cemetery contains grave
of Joseph Elison, member of Greely Arctic expedition, who died at Port
Haven, Greenland, in 1884, soon after being rescued by the late Rear
Admiral Schley; a diary, kept until his hands were frozen stiff, will
soon be published by the Pottsville Historical Society. Parks in
Schuylkill County are, “Lakeside,” above Mahony City; “Marlin,” near
Pottsville; “Manilla,” east of Tamaqua; “Woodland,” between Ashland and
Girardville; “Washington,” between Ashland and Locust Dale; they are
combinations of formal gardening with natural beauty; “Tumbling Run
Dam,” near Pottsville, is beautiful in its setting. SHENANDOAH,
population 24,726, contains a mixed mining population; twenty-six
languages and dialects are spoken here.

[Illustration: LEHIGH COUNTY]




XLVI

Hills south, containing large deposits of slate and cement. Chief
industries, agriculture and manufacturing.

ALLENTOWN, county seat, at junction of Jordan and Little Lehigh Creeks;
population 73,502; was settled in 1751 by Chief Justice William Allen, a
friend of the Penns; is entered from the south by, it is said, the
largest concrete bridge in the world, erected by a trolley company, 2650
feet long and 120 feet high; built in 1913. The city has an abundant

by the Lehigh County Historical Society; West Park and River Park are
also in Allentown; west of the city is Dorney’s Park, along Cedar Creek.
In Center Square is the Soldiers’ Monument to the men of Lehigh County
in the Civil War; on the pedestal are bronze bas-reliefs depicting
scenes of war and reconciliation, and medallion busts of Generals Meade,
McClellan, Hancock, and Hartranft. United States post office, at the
corner of Sixth and Turner Streets, classic, built in 1906; brick and
Indiana limestone; architect, George B. Page, Philadelphia. Several fine
churches of brick or stone show Italian and Gothic architecture. The
Zion Reformed, Gothic, stone, built, 1840, Hamilton Street between Sixth
and Seventh, is notable for having sheltered the Liberty Bell and the
Christ Church bells, during British occupation of Philadelphia, in 1777;
marked by tablet, placed by the Liberty Bell Chapter, Daughters of the
American Revolution. The Rhoads House, 107-109 North Seventh Street,
built, 1762, by a Revolutionary patriot, is the oldest building in the
city.

MUHLENBERG COLLEGE with preparatory school, is beautifully located at
Twenty-sixth and Chew Streets, on campus of seventy-two acres; the
buildings, brick and stone, were built from 1903 to 1915; administration
building, English Renaissance, architects, Ruhl & Lange; contains
portraits, including one of Dr. Muhlenberg, by Gilbert Stuart; the late
Peter A. Gross, in 1914, provided by will for the founding of an art
school in Muhlenberg College, and an art museum in Allentown. Allentown
College for Women, Walnut Street between Thirtieth and Thirty-first
Streets, classic; and the new high school, North Seventeenth Street,
classic Ionic, are fine buildings. At Seventeenth and Chew Streets are
the State Hospital,

[Illustration: ZION REFORMED CHURCH, ALLENTOWN

Revolution]

Georgian; brick and Indiana limestone; and the Nurses’ Home, memorial to
Judge Edward Harvey; said to be the best equipped for the purpose in the
United States, architects, Ruhl & Lange.

Road from Rittersville to Bethlehem passes Central Park, overlooking
Lehigh River, and the historic Geissinger farm, where Solomon Jennings
settled in 1736; he was a participant in the Indian Walk of 1737.
BETHLEHEM (see Northampton County). State road from Allentown to
Slatington passes through WERNERSVILLE, near where Lynford Lardner
built, in 1740, a hunting lodge, “Grouse Hall,” and where the Jordan
Reformed Church was founded in 1752, present stone building erected,
1808. Through GUTHSVILLE, Guth homestead still standing, built, 1745,
through SIEGERSVILLE, on left is Colonel H. C. Trexler’s game preserve
of 2000 acres, containing buffalo, elk, deer, and trout hatchery. To
SCHNECKSVILLE, former home of Professor Rudy, founder of the Rudy
School, Paris, in 1865, an International Association of Professors; he
was a Fellow of the French Academy. Here is Land Spring Park.

The next village, NEFFS, has an ancient graveyard, burial place of many
Revolutionary patriots. Then to SLATINGTON, heart of the slate region. A
chain bridge built over the Lehigh River in 1826 leads to LEHIGH GAP.
Another state road from Allentown goes through CATASAUQUA; here, in
1914, was celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary of the successful
uniting of the state’s two chief resources, the use of ANTHRACITE COAL
in the IRON FURNACES, by David Thomas from Wales. Coke has since
replaced anthracite, but the furnaces and the general method are much
as Thomas left them; these were the mother furnaces of the Bethlehem
Steel Works, Cambria Iron Works, Thomas Iron Works at Hockendauqua, and
the stupendous development of the iron trade in this country. A private
art collection owned by D. G. Dery, Esq., comprises an important
collection of paintings, statuary, bronzes, ivories, Chinese porcelains,
and jades. Continue on state road through Mickley’s to EGYPT. Union
Church, Lutheran and Reformed, founded, 1734, in log church; present
brick building erected, 1785. Near by is Deshler’s Fort, built, 1760,
and the Troxell-Steckel House, stone, built, 1756. A mile north is
tablet, placed by Lehigh County Historical Society, marking place where
occurred the last Indian massacre in this county, of three families in
1763.




XLVII

LEBANON COUNTY


Formed February 16, 1813; Scriptural name, from the cedar trees covering
the range of mountains on northern boundary, “Cedars of Lebanon”;
settled by Germans in the east, by the Scotch-Irish in the west. Leading
industries, agriculture, iron, tobacco. Three solid hills of rich,
magnetic iron ore have been worked for over 170 years, and still seem
inexhaustible; they require no mining, simply to be quarried; down to
the present these mines have produced more iron ore than any other
single iron ore property in the United States. In 1737, Peter Grubb
became sole owner of these ore hills; he built Hopewell forge on Hammer
Creek, and the large blast furnace was named for Cornwall, his ancestral
home in England. The property was inherited by his two sons, who were
colonels in the Revolutionary War; cannon balls and stoves were cast
here for the Continental Army. In 1798, Robert Coleman purchased
five-sixths of these ore banks; they were near the old road between
Harris Ferry and Philadelphia, known as the Berks and Dauphin Road.
Later his grandsons, Robert and G. Dawson Coleman, built furnaces on the
Union Canal, then the great means of transportation; by that time
charcoal furnaces were going out.

The construction and operation of the Union Canal through this county,
connecting the Schuylkill River at Reading with the Susquehanna at
Middletown, was a

[Illustration: LEBANON COUNTY]

[Illustration: THE OLDEST CANAL TUNNEL IN THE UNITED STATES

North Lebanon]

momentous event, with its tunnel 767 feet long, first in the United
States. Extract: “Lebanon, June 15, 1827. Last Monday evening, June
11th, the citizens of this town and vicinity had the privilege of seeing
the first boat, the _Alpha_ from Tulpehocken, come up the Union Canal
and remain at North Lebanon for the night; the next morning it continued
its journey westward and passed through the tunnel; this was the first
boat to pass through a tract of ground upon which corn and potatoes were
being grown.”

County seat, LEBANON, population 24,643, on the William Penn Highway;
settled in 1750. Streets run north and south, east and west. Courthouse,
at the corner of Eighth and Cumberland Streets, colonial, brick. United
States post office, classic, with Doric columns. A historic inn, the St.
Eitz, built in 1752, was occupied by George Washington. Hill Church,
colonial, brick; in the yard is a monument to Rev. John Casper Stoever,
first Lutheran minister in Lebanon County, in 1733. St. Luke’s
Protestant Episcopal Church, Gothic, stone, built without a nail, has
three memorial windows, “The Nativity,” by Lamb; others made in England;
also fine collection of altar cloths, chasubles, and credence cloth made
abroad, in filet, of fifteenth century design. Soldiers and sailors’
monument in Monument Park; tall, fluted column with Ionic capital.
Lebanon Historical Society has collections of local interest. ANNVILLE
is seat of Lebanon Valley College, founded by the United Brethren in
1865; a school of high grade under supervision of that church.

MT. GRETNA, a camp ground of 1000 or more acres, 1000 feet above sea
level, was purchased by the state for mobilization of the state’s
National Guard. It will accommodate 20,000 men, and has been used for
this purpose since 1885. The War Department considers Mt. Gretna an
ideal military camp, sanitary and well drained. SCHAEFFERSTOWN, one of
the earliest and most historic places in this county, laid out in 1744,
had the first waterworks system in the United States, in 1753. Franklin
House built in 1750; in the cellar there is a remarkable series of
carved arches; it served as a place of refuge from Indians. Fountain
Hill Park is here. MYERSTOWN is the seat of Albright College.
FREDERICKSBURG has the Lick Monument, erected, in 1881, by James Lick,
in memory of his grandfather’s services at Valley Forge, and of John
Lick, founder of Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, California.




XLVIII

UNION COUNTY


Formed March 22, 1813, named for the Union; chiefly agricultural, is
divided by spurs of the Alleghenies, known as White Deer, Nittany,
Buffalo, Paddy’s, and Jack’s mountains, into three valleys; the center,
Buffalo Valley, is one of the garden spots in Pennsylvania, formerly
home of many Amish and Dunkards, good farmers and citizens.

LEWISBURG, county seat, laid out in 1785; population 3204; named for
Ludwig (Lewis) Doerr, who purchased the land from Richard Peters of
Philadelphia. A rare specimen of conveyancing is deed, lot 51, in plan
of Lewisburg, tracing title from the Creator, down through Adam and Eve,
to one Flavel Roan, recorded at Sunbury, in deed book F, 1793. Finely
located at mouth of Buffalo Creek, West Branch of the Susquehanna, on
the great Indian path from Sunbury to Muncy, now main highway from
Harrisburg to Williamsport, and on line of turnpikes leading from Erie
through Waterford, Meadville, and Franklin to Susquehanna River. Seat of
Bucknell University, incorporated in 1846, co-ed, with courses in arts,
science, philosophy, and engineering; the Library and Museum have the
Jeremiah Gernerd collection of Indian relics, open to the public; from
the top of the astronomical observatory is a fine view. In Lewisburg
Cemetery is the grave of Colonel John Kelly, distinguished in Indian
warfare and the Revolution; he died in 1832; his

[Illustration: UNION COUNTY]

monument, with military emblems, was erected in 1835, sculptor, W.
Hubbard; also the grave of Mary, widow of Captain John Brady, the great
Indian fighter, who was massacred by Indians and buried near where he
fell, in Lycoming County.

One mile west of Lewisburg, from the top of Smoketown Hill, is a fine
view of Buffalo Valley across the Susquehanna to Muncy Hills and North
Mountain. Historic places, site of Shikellimy’s old town, a wooded crest
opposite Milton, four miles north of Lewisburg; he was chief of the
Oneidas, and father of Logan the Mingo chief, place now called Oak
Heights. DRIESBACH, five miles west of Lewisburg, German Reformed and
Lutheran Church, first log building built, 1788, on site of present
brick church; in burial ground is the grave and monument to Samuel
Maclay, born, 1741, brother of William Maclay; inscription, “Samuel
Maclay, United States Senator 1803-09, Surveyor, Farmer, Soldier,
Legislator, Statesman. Erected by State of Pennsylvania, 1908.” Buffalo
X Roads, Presbyterian Church, first built, 1775, present brick building
about 1846.

MIFFLINBURG, the neatest town you ever saw, with uniform curbing and
walks, population 1744, in heart of Buffalo Valley (named for Governor
Mifflin); ten miles west of Lewisburg, laid out 1792, by Elias Youngman.
NEW BERLIN, laid out, 1792, by George Long, delightfully situated on
north bank of Penn’s Creek; first county seat; at one time home of Union
Seminary, Central Pennsylvania College.

[Illustration: COLUMBIA COUNTY]




XLIX

COLUMBIA COUNTY


Formed March 22, 1813, name explains itself: is in Appalachian Mountain
belt; surface quite broken, with wonderfully beautiful drives. The
Catawissa Railroad, noted for its remarkable trestle bridges, first one
at Mainville, runs through this county, crossing the Susquehanna River
at Rupert. Arable land, mostly red shale and limestone, with deposits of
iron ore at Bloomsburg, and the anthracite coal basin at Centralia.
Chief industries, manufacturing; the carpet mill here is said to be the
second largest in the United States. Earliest historical bands of
Indians, in this county, were the Shawnees and Delawares, vassals to the
Six Nations; Wyoming Path, their route of travel for hunting or war,
left Muncy on the West Branch, ran up Glade Run, through a gap to
Fishing Creek and on to Luzerne County, through Nescopec Gap, and up
North Branch to Wyoming.

BLOOMSBURG, population 7819, laid out in 1802 by Ludwig Eyre, on a bluff
on Fishing Creek, became county seat in 1846. In 1772, the Shawnee
Indians had a village between the mouth of the creek and the town. James
McClure located his farm near the same point in 1781; a fort was erected
there, built by Major Moses VanCampen, now marked, from which he led
scouting parties. In 1779, VanCampen, as quartermaster, accompanied
General Sullivan’s expedition against Indian towns on the Genessee.
There is much discussion here about city planning. The town lies due
north and south, named streets; east and west numbered; Second Street
being the main street, and also forms part of state highway leading from
Harrisburg to Wilkes-Barre. Courthouse on Main Street, Renaissance;
contains, it is said, “a very beautiful piece of tapestry.” Jail, stone,
feudal architecture. Soldiers and Sailors’ Monument at the intersection
of Main and Market Streets, erected in 1908.

The Methodist Church, Gothic, stone, has a Tiffany window, “Christ
Blessing Little Children”; other churches that may be mentioned for
architecture are St. Paul’s Protestant Episcopal and First Presbyterian,
both Gothic; St. Matthew’s, Evangelical Lutheran, Trinity Reformed, and
St. Columba’s Roman Catholic, colonial. In 1869, this was made the
educational center of northeast Pennsylvania, with the State Normal
School, corner-stone laid by Governor Geary in 1868. Normal auditorium,
colonial; and other extensive buildings. CATAWISSA, originally a Quaker
settlement; scenery fine and picturesque; was laid out in 1787 by
William Hughes from Berks County; has an old Friends’ meeting house.
John Hanch was one of the first to build an iron furnace here on the
Catawissa in 1816; earlier the Piscatawese or Gangawese (Kenhawas) had
wigwams here. Fort Jenkins, near mouth of Briar Creek, on the
Susquehanna, was attacked and burned by Indians, 1779-80; a house is now
on the site of the fort. BERWICK was settled by Evan Owen in 1783. Here
in 1826 the steamboat _Susquehanna_ blew up while ascending the Nescopec
Falls. Also ground was broken here for the North Branch Canal.




L

PIKE COUNTY


Formed March 26, 1814, named for General Zebulon Pike, killed in Canada,
1813. When the chronicler takes up his pen to write of the glories of
Pike County in works of art, architecture, and monuments to the departed
“Great,” in peace or war, he is somewhat appalled at the dearth of them;
the landmarks are what God made, softened and beautified by time.

MILFORD, county seat, population 768, was laid out by John Biddis, 1793,
in squares, after pattern of Philadelphia; it rests high above the
Delaware River, overlooking a valley of myriad hues that have made the
town notable for its quaint, umbrageous beauty and repose. Pioneer
settlers were substantial people whose descendants still reside here. It
is a popular resort for trout fishing in the spring, vacationists in the
summer, and for deer and bird hunting in the fall. Courthouse, brick,
French design, built in 1873, in center of town, facing the public
square; two mortars from the Civil War are in the front lawn; opposite
is the jail, built in 1815 as courthouse and jail, made of native
boulders carefully selected for shades and tints; some are opalescent
and show brilliantly in certain lights; a wooden trout, five foot long,
pointing the way of the wind, is as old as the building.

Forestry building, probably handsomest village structure of its kind in
the United States, erected in 1900 by the late James Wallace Pinchot,
Normandy

[Illustration: PIKE COUNTY]

design; native stone; architects, Hunt & Hunt; in niches are busts of
Washington and Franklin; mortised in alternately are bas-reliefs of F.
A. Michaux, 1746-1802, author of “Flora Boreali Americana”; General
Lafayette in 1777; and Bernard Palissy, 1506-89, potter, and writer on
botany and forestry; sculptor, J. F. Weir. The Homestead Library,
formerly home of Cyrille Pinchot, pure colonial, is in center of town;
to the rear is Normandie Cottage, an architectural gem, replica of a
peasant’s home cottage.

Gray Towers, the Pinchot estate, native stone, reproduction of a
baronial castle in the Scottish Highlands, crowns the hill about 1000
feet above Milford; the old Scotch garden, with high stone wall, is of
rare beauty; Yale School of Forestry is on the Pinchot estate, within
echo of the Sawkill Falls. Monument to Tom Quick, the avenger of the
Delaware, is on his birthplace; he killed ninety-nine Indians to avenge
the death of his father, who was the first settler in Milford, in 1733.
The principal denominations are represented in the churches. Old inns
are, the Crissman House, built, 1810; the Sawkill House, 1823, southern
colonial; the Dimmick House, 1828, Horace Greeley stopped here in 1840
and later; one of his fondest hopes was the coöperative, community of
interest settlement, known as the “Sylvania Society,” which he, with
others, organized in 1842 at Greeley; founded on the “Sacredness of
toil,” but the young men, sons of affluent parents, who had been sent
there by New Yorkers who bought stock, did not know how to work, nor did
they wish to learn, and so they deserted.

The Bluff House on the banks of the Delaware, built, 1876, commands a
fine view; lawn of Milford Inn is planted with rare shrubs and trees
from all parts of the world; the Hermitage has three unique bronze
sundials, sculptor, Louis F. Ragot; the one depicting Father Time with
upraised reaper, is beautiful. The Hermit’s Glen, so a legend goes, is
where an old French hermit of profound knowledge and benevolence found
the water of life after a world-wide search; these waters now flow into
the lake through two bronze masques; two cement giants hold up the dam
that feeds the lake. Wells Glen lies along the Sawkill Brook;
rhododendrons, wood flowers, and giant hemlocks make it beautiful.
Childs Park, back of DINGMAN’S FERRY, given in perpetuity for use of the
public by Mrs. G. W. Childs, is a rugged mountain stretch, woodland and
meadow; cataracts and deep pools are in the trout stream that comes
through it.

BUSHKILL, another haunt for nature lovers, and SHOHOLA, all remarkable
for beautiful falls, glens, caves. In writing of the Delaware Valley,
Edmund Clarence Stedman says: “But here there is no swooning of the
languid air, and no seeming always afternoon; it is a morning land with
every cliff facing the rising sun; the mist and languor are in the grain
fields far below; the hills themselves are of the richest, darkest
green; the skies are blue and fiery; the air crisp, oxygenated,
American; it is no place for lotus eating, but for drinking water of the
fountain of youth, till one feels the zest and thrill of a new life that
is not unrestful, yet as far as may be from the lethargy of mere
repose.” Among the artists who have painted here are, William M. Chase,
J. Alden Weir, Swayne Gifford, Carroll Beckwith, Henry Satterlee,
Charles C. Curran, W. A. Rogers, and Benjamin Constant, France.

LI

PERRY COUNTY


Formed March 12, 1820; named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry; lying
between the Tuscarora and the Blue Mountains, it abounds in beautiful
scenery, low hills, rich valleys, and abundant streams. Chief industry,
agriculture.

NEW BLOOMFIELD, county seat, settled in 1820; streets run due east and
west, north and south. Courthouse faces the center square; colonial with
cupola, brick; built in 1868; fireproof annex, built, 1892. Soldiers’
Monument in the square, memorial to soldiers and sailors of Perry
County. Among the good church buildings may be noted the Methodist;
architect, M. A. Kast, Harrisburg. SHERMANSDALE was in 1720 an Indian
village. At MARYSVILLE a long stone arch bridge on the Pennsylvania
Railroad line crosses over the Susquehanna River from Rockville, Dauphin
County. The Marysville Civic Club has done much for the improvement of
the town, and has beautified the town square and schoolyard.

Beyond DUNCANNON, where an immense traffic in coal and iron is carried
on, one goes through the valley of the beautiful Juniata; the scenery
along this river, as one crosses ridge after ridge of the Alleghenies is
most picturesque, and the region traversed is full of historical
reminiscences of the struggles of the early Scotch-Irish colonists with
the Indians, and of the enterprise of David Brainard and other
missionaries. At MILLERSTOWN one threads the Tuscarora Gap, where the
railway, river, road, and canal squeeze their way through a narrow
defile; this lay in the land of the Tuscarora Indians.

JUNIATA COUNTY

LII


Formed March 2, 1831; name, from the Juniata River, was given by the
original people who lived in this region, and who were obliterated by
the Iroquois; root of word means “a stone.” “Standing Stone” may be
regarded as translation of “Onojutta-Haga” or the Juniata people. A
mountainous country with many fertile valleys, situated between the
Tuscarora and Blue Ridge Mountains, famous for its scenery, with the
blue Juniata making a wide sweep. The old Pennsylvania canal followed
its banks throughout its whole course. First settlers were mostly
Scotch-Irish.

The old homestead of Francis Innis, one and a half stories, stone, east
of McCoysville, is still in possession of descendants, now used as a
spring house; his two children, captured by the Indians, were recovered
among those delivered to Colonel Bouquet in 1764. Another old landmark,
eight miles away, is the D. B. Esh house, on east Waterford Road, built
by Mr. Graham in 1802; has an open stairway carved by hand. First road
laid out in 1768, was from Sherman’s Valley to Kishecoquelas Valley. The
historic road between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, through the famous
Jack’s Narrows, over which stage coaches traveled, is now part of the
William Penn Highway. Sites of Forts Bingham and Patterson will soon be
marked by the General Thomas Mifflin Chapter,

[Illustration: JUNIATA COUNTY]

Daughters of the American Revolution. Chief industries, agriculture and
manufactories.

MIFFLINTOWN, county seat, population 1083, joined with its twin borough,
MIFFLIN, on Pennsylvania Railroad main line, by bridge over the Juniata,
was laid out in 1791 by John Harris, and named in honor of the governor
of the state, General Mifflin. Courthouse in center of town on Main
Street, built, 1874, brick, Georgian, with Ionic porch and cupola; in
the yard is a monument, surmounted by a spread eagle, to Civil War
soldiers from Juniata County, erected in 1870. The churches are of good
architecture, and the graded high school is said to be the best between
Harrisburg and Huntingdon.

[Illustration: MONROE COUNTY]




LIII

MONROE COUNTY


Formed April 1, 1836; named in honor of President James Monroe. The
Pocono Mountains and long, fertile valleys cover the surface. Chief
industries, farming, lumber, and manufacturing. In the southeast, where
the Delaware River turns suddenly at Mount Kittatinny, towering 1600
feet above it, is the Delaware Water Gap, with views of great distance
from the highest point; near are the Wind Gap and Smith’s Gap; William
Penn’s famous Walking Land Purchase ended near here. The Milford Road,
laid out about 1800, from Easton, leaves Delaware River at Water Gap
village, thence four miles to Stroudsburg, then to Bushkill and beyond.

STROUDSBURG, county seat; population 5278; first settled by Jacob
Stroud, laid out at right angles, with a liberal plan of broad avenues,
and houses set back thirty feet from the sidewalk, resembles a New
England village. Courthouse, built, 1890, of rough stone, with high
chimneys and belfry, contains portraits of judges; with jail and county
house forms group facing the public square. Churches are of all
principal denominations. The National Bank and other buildings are
chiefly by Lacy & Son, architects. A fine stone and iron bridge, built
by the state, over Broadhead Creek, connects the two boroughs of
Stroudsburg and East Stroudsburg; it replaced a wooden one, over one
hundred years old, carried away by the freshet in 1862. In 1755,
Indians crossed over the old bridge, burned Dansbury Mission and other
buildings, leaving Stroudsburg without a house or resident. Ephraim
Collver, who had a grist mill there, escaped with his family to the
Moravians at Bethlehem.

About 1756, a line of forts were erected to protect the frontier
settlements; sites are unmarked; Fort Norris at Greensweigo, Eldred
Township, on road toward the Minisinks, eighty feet square, was
completely stockaded. Fort Hyndshaw, at the mouth of Bushkill Creek, was
built for the Revolutionary War. Fort Hamilton was built in 1757, some
one hundred feet beyond the Lutheran Church in western part of the town.
Fort Penn, center of town, was residence of Jacob Stroud, who died in
1806; here in 1778, he cared for thirty or more persons, fugitives from
the Wyoming massacre, who crossed the Pocono plateau with great toil and
distress, later proceeding to their former homes in Connecticut. At
Locust Ridge in Wyoming Valley, a battle was fought called the Pennamite
War, between Connecticut claimants and Pennsylvanians. General Sullivan
and his troops, in 1779, laid out a road through this county, from Wind
Gap to Stoddartsville, Wilkes-Barre, and on, continuing an expedition
from Easton to Genessee Valley, against the Indians; it may still be
traced almost the entire way. General Daniel Brodhead and most of his
male relatives from Monroe County, were in the Revolutionary War.

Monroe County was a portion of the lands of the Minisinks; there were
several Indian villages; the Delaware chief, Tedyuscung, born on the
Pocono Mountains, resided here. It is said that the first white
settlement in Pennsylvania was at Shawnee, by the Low Dutch or
Hollanders, in “Meenesink,” many years before William Penn’s charter.
When Nicholas Scull surveyed the land for the province, Samuel Depui was
here; he purchased land in 1727 from the Minsi Indians, now site of
Shawnee, an attractive village, five miles east of Stroudsburg; and the
same property later from William Allen, 1733, for whom the oldest survey
in the county was made.

[Illustration: CLARION COUNTY]




LIV

CLARION COUNTY


Formed March 11, 1839; named from Clarion River. The scenery is
beautiful and diversified; at the highest point, over 1600 feet above
sea level, a flagstaff has been erected; from here, on a clear day, may
be seen the bridge at East Brady and four villages in the far distance.
Hills and valleys are dotted here and there with oil and gas wells.
There are beautiful views along the Clarion and Allegheny rivers and
Redbank Creek; the scenery at East Brady is notable on account of the
precipitous hills and winding streams. First white settler was Captain
Samuel Brady of Revolutionary fame; his parents having been killed by
Indians, he swore vengeance against them. He conducted an expedition in
1779 under General Brodhead, who had started with a large force from
Fort Pitt. The Indians had become troublesome along the Allegheny River;
Brady, in advance with scouts, discovered them on a flat rock at a place
which is now East Brady; he took possession of a narrow pass, and when
the Indians arrived, he opened fire, with the main army in the rear;
escape was impossible, and nearly all were killed or taken prisoners.

In early days this region was called “The Iron City,” on account of its
many furnaces; forty were in operation at one time, they are now cinders
and banks of earth. The oil production in this county has been
wonderful; 5000 oil wells were drilled in Clarion after 1870, and there
is still much wealth in it; other industries are gas, coal, and
agriculture. Two long tunnels are at Madison Furnace on the railroad
between Clarion and Franklin; it is said there are but two longer ones
in the world. The first bridge was built across Clarion River in 1834.
The present one, which is of fine construction, is the third.

CLARION, population, 2,793, made county seat in 1840; is finely located
on a hill 1500 feet above sea level, on the Bellefonte and Meadville
Turnpike. Public buildings face the park; Courthouse, third
reconstruction, completed in 1882, Georgian; architect, Mr. Betts;
contains portraits of judges. Jail, Norman architecture, stone with
brick front, was built in 1874. Connected with the State Normal School
is a stone chapel containing busts of Abraham Lincoln and Henry W.
Longfellow; also Navaree Hall, Spanish architecture, stone, brick, and
concrete; architects, Allison & Allison, Pittsburgh.

Among the six churches are the Methodist and Presbyterian, stone, Roman
architecture. The Woman’s Club has accomplished much for civic
improvement, changing the cemetery from an unsightly spot to a place of
beauty, planting the park with shrubbery and flower beds, and starting a
free public library; in the park is a monument to Civil War soldiers. At
FOXBURG is a fine free, memorial library; colonial; native sandstone;
architect, Arthur H. Brockie, Philadelphia. In the “Memorial Church of
Our Father,” native sandstone; architect, James Sims, Philadelphia; is a
painting by Edwin Howland Blashfield, “The Angel of the Resurrection.”




LV

CLINTON COUNTY


Formed June 21, 1839; named for DeWitt Clinton. Has superb scenic
beauty; lofty mountains, rolling hills, and highly productive valleys
border the West Branch of the Susquehanna River. About one-fourth is
State Forest Reserve of mountainous wilderness, where large and small
game, trout, and other fish abound. Chief industries are in vast deposit
of commercial clay, from which is made fire, building and paving brick,
tile sewer pipe, and concrete blocks; and a large chemical plant, very
important in war chemicals; agriculture, including tobacco growing;
several creameries and a large milk condensery.

LOCK HAVEN, with advance road signs, county seat; population 8559.
Through the efforts of the city government, Board of Trade, and Women’s
Civic Club, John Nolen, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was engaged to
prepare a formal “City Plan” for the future growth and development of
the city. This plan includes no radical changes or extravagant
improvements, but conforms to the requirements of a small community.
Embraces simple, but definite plans for the esthetic improvement of the
fronts of the Susquehanna and Bald Eagle Rivers, between which Lock
Haven is situated. The proper location and grouping of future public
buildings, with a civic center at Monument Place, the intersection of
the two main thoroughfares.

[Illustration: CLINTON COUNTY]

[Illustration: THE SUSQUEHANNA TRAIL

River front of Lock Haven]

The installation of modern street lighting systems with underground
wires. And the gradual improvements in store fronts and business places.

[Illustration]

It calls for the establishment of drives, playgrounds, and parks; the
acquiring of a woodland reservation, adjoining Highland Cemetery, at the
edge of the town, for a public park; and purchase of an outlying
mountain top for future recreation. Much of the plan has been carried
out. A unique and beautiful parkway has been made by utilizing the
abandoned basin of the old canal, which cut through the heart of Lock
Haven; it had become a dump heap, but under the Nolen plan was filled,
and has blossomed into one of the show places of the city, with flower
beds, lawn, trees, and special landscape garden effect at each end. The
river front has been made into a park, at entrance to the bridge, over
the Susquehanna, a modern structure built by the state, which replaced a
picturesque, covered bridge built, 1855, about 800 feet long; it
includes the old toll house, pronounced by Mr. Nolen a valuable asset
for the city. A smaller, quaint, old covered wood bridge, same period,
about four miles from Lock Haven, spans Bald Eagle stream, on Bald Eagle
Valley Road; near is the Clinton “Country Club” house, artistically
built of cobblestones, architect, Lester Kintzing, New York.

The Courthouse, red brick and brownstone, surmounted by two dome-shaped
towers, built in 1869, on site of an earlier one built, 1842, is on
Water Street facing the river. On the river front is a stone marker,
inscription, “Located in the stockade of Fort Reed, built, 1775, for
defense against the Indians.” On the river road, leading to
Williamsport, near McElhattan, is site of Fort Horn, stone marker, both
placed by the Hugh White Chapter, D. A. R., to mark the last two, of the
trail of stockade fortifications, built along the river in defense of
the pioneer settlers. Where Lock Haven stands was original site of
several Indian villages; burial places; and marked one of their great
thoroughfares from the north to the coast. Granite monument to 1938
soldiers of Clinton County in the Civil War is in center of city.

St. Paul’s Protestant Episcopal Church, stone, Gothic, with spire,
built, 1852, on Main Street, has memorial windows by Tiffany and Lamb,
New York, and chancel window from England. The Immaculate Conception,
Roman Catholic Church, built, 1905, and rectory, 1915, Gothic, with two
towers, Hummelstone brownstone, architect, J. A. Dempwolf, York, Pa.,
corner of Water and Third Streets, is on site of an earlier church,
built in 1857, dedicated by Rev. John C. Gilligan, pioneer missionary.
Central State Normal School, on ground given by Philip Price of
Philadelphia, founded, 1871, includes twelve buildings, on thirty-two
acres of land, commanding extended view; the main building was erected
in 1890, architect, A. S. Wagner, Williamsport; art course includes the
theory and practice of teaching art; industrial art and lectures on art
history; reproductions of paintings, and European architecture, also
replicas of sculpture, are placed about the buildings.

Ross Memorial Free Library, on Main Street, opened, 1910, further
endowed by the late Wilson Kistler, sends traveling libraries to rural
schools; contains painting by E. H. Shearer, “Ole Bull’s Castle in
Potter Co.”; a noteworthy collection of North American Indian relics,
10,000 pieces, owned by Dr. T. B. Stewart, has been offered as a loan to
this library, the collection is especially rich in local relics of
domestic life and implements of war. “The Fallon House,” built in 1855,
still in excellent condition, is said to have been built with funds of
Queen Isabella II, of Spain, who invested largely of her private fortune
in Pennsylvania, for a retreat in case of revolution. In Highland
Cemetery is an exact reproduction of the St. Martin’s Cross, 16 feet 8
inches high, on the Island of Iona, off the coast of Scotland, erected
in 1914, in memory of Samuel Richard Peale.

[Illustration: WYOMING COUNTY]




LVI

WYOMING COUNTY


Formed April 4, 1842; named from the Wyoming tribe of Indians who
occupied the land when the white settlers came; name signifies extensive
flats.

Lies in the northern opening of the wonderful Wyoming Valley, celebrated
for its fertility and beauty; surface diversified by numerous spurs of
the Appalachian system, which tower into lofty peaks; Mount Solecca,
1000 feet above the river; Mount Chodano, nearly opposite, about the
same height; Mount Metchasaung, still higher, at La Grange. Several
lakes are well stocked with fish; the largest, Lake Cary, three miles
long, one mile wide, is surrounded by lofty pines and hemlocks. Glen
Moneypenny, six miles below Tunkhannock, is a wildly picturesque
location; many such are to be found among the mountains of this country.

This beautiful setting was the scene of Indian plottings that culminated
in the Wyoming Massacre in 1778 (see Luzerne County). The following year
General Sullivan’s army passed through this region, on march to subdue
the Six Nations, and encamped on the shore of the Susquehanna River at
Tunkhannock, where the tannery now stands. Forty years ago passenger
pigeons were so plentiful that when they flew across a town in dense
flocks, they obscured the sun; one colony occupied a strip of woodland
in Wyoming County, seven miles long by three miles wide; Alexander
Wilson wrote of counting ninety nests in a single tree. Chief
industries, agriculture and manufacturing.

TUNKHANNOCK, county seat; population 1736, first called Putnam, after
General Israel Putnam of Revolutionary War; settled, 1790; was
incorporated 1841. Lies due north and south, east and west. Courthouse
on Courthouse Square has two marble tablets in the corridor, with names
of Revolutionary War soldiers buried within the limits of Wyoming
County, placed by Tunkhannock Chapter, Daughters of the American
Revolution. The Soldiers’ Monument is on the same grounds. Among the
churches of different denominations, the Methodist may be mentioned for
Gothic architecture. At FACTORYVILLE is the Keystone Academy. Crossing
Tunkhannock Creek, near Nicholson, is the Tunkhannock Viaduct, said to
be the largest concrete bridge in the world, 2375 feet long, 240 feet
high, above water level; height from bedrock 300 feet; carries the
double tracks of the main line of the Lackawanna Railroad from mountain
to mountain across the valley.




LVII

CARBON COUNTY


Formed March 13, 1843; named for its coal deposits; coal was first
discovered by Philip Ginter in 1791, on top of Sharp Mountain, now town
of Summit Hill, nine miles southwest of Mauch Chunk. In 1818 the Lehigh
Navigation Company and the Lehigh Coal Company were formed; under
skilful management the almost insuperable obstacles in the way of
transportation were overcome; boats 18 feet wide by 25 feet long, two or
more hinged together, were floated by artificial freshets on the Lehigh;
owing to the great fall in the river and consequent rapidity of its
motion, dams were constructed near Mauch Chunk, with sluice gates,
invented by Josiah White, a manager of the Navigation Company; they were
the first on record used permanently; Lehigh coal is the hardest known
anthracite in the world. Other mineral productions are iron, slate, and
mineral paint. Wire rope was first invented in Mauch Chunk.

The first settlers were Moravian missionaries who, in 1746, purchased
200 acres on the north side of Mahoning Creek above its mouth, for
converted Mohican Indians; each Indian family possessed their own lot of
ground and Gnadenhütten became a town; the church stood in the valley,
with the Indian houses forming a crescent on one side, on the other side
was the missionary’s house and burial ground. The road to Wyoming lay
through the settlement, being the

[Illustration: CARBON COUNTY]

famous Warrior’s Path over Nescopec Mountain. In August all partook of
their own first fruits in a love feast. Christian Ranch and Martin Mack
were the first missionaries residing here; several parts of Scripture
had been translated into the Mohican language; the Holy Communion was
administered every month, the Indians calling that “The Great Day.” In
1749 Bishop (Baron) John de Watterville went to Gnadenhütten and laid
the foundation of a large church; Indian congregation 500 persons. After
Braddock’s defeat in 1755 the whole frontier was open to the savage foe;
suddenly in 1757, the mission house on the Mahoning was attacked and
burnt by French and Indians, and many inhabitants were murdered; a broad
marble slab, placed there in 1788, near LEHIGHTON, marks the grave of
those massacred.

In 1756 Benjamin Franklin was authorized by the Provincial Government to
erect forts on the Lehigh; one opposite Gnadenhütten was named Fort
Allen, for William Allen, the Chief Justice. At WEISSPORT, in the rear
of the “Fort Allen House” may be seen the well dug under Franklin’s
supervision; it was within the inclosure of the fort and supplied the
soldiers with water. Weissport was settled by Colonel Jacob Weiss,
Quartermaster General in the Revolutionary Army, on site of Fort Allen.
Municipal parks are at Lehighton and Weissport, given by Jacob Weiss.
Also at Lehighton is All Saints’ Chapel, early English Gothic.

In 1780 Andrew Montour, leader of an Indian party, captured the Gilbert
family, twelve persons, and took them over Mauch Chunk and Broad
Mountains into the Nescopec path, across Quakake Creek to Mahoning
Mountain and over wild and rugged country to Canada; eventually they
were all redeemed at Montreal, in 1782, and returned to Byberry. A view
of great scenic beauty is from Prospect Rock, over the Nescopec Valley;
Cloud Point, frequently covered by vapor, may be seen; near is Glen
Thomas with a picturesque Amber Cascade, named for David Thomas, pioneer
in the iron trade. GLEN ONOKO, two miles above Mauch Chunk, with its
wild beauty, total ascent over 900 feet, forms the channel for the clear
stream which flows over innumerable cascades to the Lehigh; the most
noticeable are “Chameleon Falls,” fifty feet high, and “Onoko Falls,”
ninety feet high, with overhanging rocks, covered with moss and ferns.

MAUCH CHUNK, county seat, population 3666; Indian name means Bear
Mountain; first settled in 1815; has one principal street, following the
tortuous course of Mauch Chunk Creek as it winds through a narrow gorge
between three high, steep, and rocky mountains, averaging 850 feet above
the town. The important buildings are directly on this street.
Courthouse, Norman, brownstone, quarried at Rockport, Carbon County;
built in 1894. Jail, where some of the Molly Maguires were executed. The
Dimmick Memorial Library, built in 1890, brick. Churches here and in
East Mauch Chunk are unusually handsome. St. Mark’s Protestant
Episcopal, Gothic, stone, has memorial windows by J. & R. Lamb; the
reredos is very beautiful. First Presbyterian, colonial, brick, has a
memorial window by John LaFarge, and one by Tiffany. The Immaculate
Conception, Roman

[Illustration: ST. MARK’S P. E. CHURCH, MAUCH CHUNK

This church is built on solid rock]

Catholic, also has fine stained-glass windows. St. Paul’s Methodist
Episcopal is the oldest church in the town.

The Woman’s Clubs are seeking to improve conditions, sanitary and
scenic; to widen the life of the town and in every way make it more in
unison with its natural surroundings. In the limited space of the narrow
valley, land is too precious to be used except for buildings, but the
hills are so magnificent that they look to them for the necessary
beauty; Flagstaff Park has natural effect. The first railroad in Carbon
County and one of the oldest in the United States, is the famous
SWITCHBACK, a gravity road, extending from Mauch Chunk to SUMMIT HILL,
opened in 1832, for bringing coal from the mines to the canal; used now
only for pleasure; a double track is laid to the summit of Mount Pisgah,
2322 feet distant from the foot, at an angle of twenty degrees, with
elevation about 900 feet above the river. Scene from the top is superb,
with a succession of mountain ridges rising, range after range, with
distant view of Lehigh Water Gap, and farther to Schooley’s Mountain in
New Jersey. The principal attraction at Summit Hill is the burning mine,
discovered to be on fire in 1859. General Craig of Revolutionary fame
resided here.

[Illustration: ELK COUNTY]




LVIII

ELK COUNTY


Formed April 18, 1843; possesses everywhere great scenic beauty; a large
herd of elk, last-known herd of the Black Forest, still existed, for
which the county was named; the last elk was killed in 1857. The Black
Forest formerly covered a vast area of northwest Pennsylvania, the deep
green of the hemlock giving a mystery of blackness; here many varieties
of large and small animals abounded. Climate and geological formation
differ from surrounding counties in ratio of altitude; the growing
season is usually two or three weeks later on account of late frosts;
agriculture is now chief industry. Bituminous coal was discovered by
“Blind Mike” on Priest’s Land at St. Mary’s in 1853, and is continuously
worked. Natural gas, oil, high-grade clays, and shale are other mineral
resources. Jimanandy Park, 3600 acres of almost virgin forest, stocked
with deer; through which a trout run flows, is the property of heirs of
Senator James K. P. Hall, and Honorable Andrew Kaul; permission to
inspect the park may be obtained at office of J. R. P. Hall at St.
Mary’s.

RIDGWAY, county seat, laid out in 1843 and named for Jacob Ridgway,
Philadelphia, who was United States Consul at Antwerp; population 6037.
Courthouse, center of town, built in 1872, brick, with clock tower,
surmounted by a large statue of Justice; stands in a well-kept park with
jail in the rear. Main Street, very wide, paved with brick, has many
fine residences. Forest Lawn Cemetery contains the Hall and Hyde family
mausoleums and a large community mausoleum built in 1912. ST. MARY’S,
ten miles from Ridgway, along the state road through beautiful scenery,
is largest town in the county, population 6967; known as the Summit
City, on a high plateau, altitude 1660 to 1950 feet. Has wide streets
paved with brick, and is surrounded by a fertile farming country. The
Charles A. Luke Memorial Park, four acres, acquired by gift in 1873 for
the public, was laid out by George C. Miller, landscape gardener of
Boston, Massachusetts, in 1914, through St. Mary’s Village Association.

St. Mary’s Roman Catholic Church, oldest and largest in the county,
built in the fifties by the German Catholic colonists, from plans made
by the late Ignatius Garner, native undressed sandstone, recently
dressed with cement, spoiling its rusticity. In St. Mary’s Cemetery are
buried Baron Van Essel and many war veterans. Large German Benedictine
College and Convent conducted by the Sisters of St. Benedict,
established, 1862, is one of the three schools in America which teach
the Della Sade system of voice culture, introduced by the venerable
Sister Marie who learned the system of the great Italian master. In the
Convent is said to be an original Van Dyke painting. Sacred Heart
Church, native sandstone, Gothic. The Shiloh Presbyterian Church is an
ecclesiastical building of native sandstone. At St. Mary’s and Kersey
Road is a small chapel, wood, old German design, built in 1870 by the
late George Decker, in fulfillment of a vow; prayer service is held here
at stated times.

Going east from Kersey, road leads through “The Barrens,” a sandy rocky
stretch of land denuded of vegetation by forest fires, on the old
Bellefonte Pike. Scenery is wonderful toward MOUNT ZION, where there is
a typical country church and burial ground. At Mount Zion corner, the
road takes three courses; left leads to BYRNEDALE with its fifty coke
ovens, coal tipples, and washer plant. WILCOX, in northern part of
county, lying in the famous gas belt of Elk County, has large glass
factory. A few miles back is TAMBINE; near here President Grant, guest
of General Thomas Kane, spent a day fishing for trout. From Wilcox,
along the Big Level Road, is Rasselas; here Captain (later General) Kane
pinned a buck’s tail on the hat of Hiram Woodruff, first member
recruited for the Bucktail Regiment. On the old Milesburg and Clermont
Pike, William C. Walsh carried the first mail through this section in
1828.

[Illustration: BLAIR COUNTY]




LIX

BLAIR COUNTY


Formed February 26, 1846; named for Honorable John Blair, native of this
county, and public-spirited citizen; in 1820, he laid out, and was
President of the Huntingdon, Cambria and Indiana Turnpike, first in this
section. Blair County lies in the beautiful Juniata Valley, settled by
Scotch-Irish, English, and Germans; much of the soil is very fertile.
Chief industries, agriculture, coal mining, and manufacturing. It is the
center of a network of roads, mostly built as turnpikes from 1830-50;
now state roads.

TYRONE, altitude 692 feet above sea level, population 9084; outlet for
important bituminous coal products; lies in a basin formed by the base
line of old Tussey, a famous mountain, and the bold ridge known as Bald
Eagle. The home of Captain John Logan, eldest son of Shikellamy, was at
mouth of Bald Eagle Creek; second son, James Logan, the Mingo chief,
named for Secretary Logan of Germantown, went west to the Ohio; his son
(Tod-kahdohs) married a daughter of Chief Cornplanter. About three miles
east from Tyrone is the Sinking Valley, named from the Sinking Creek, an
underground watercourse; near is BIRMINGHAM, with a pleasure ground,
where there are one hundred springs and a large cave; a school for girls
is here.

ALTOONA, population 60,331; altitude 1171 feet above sea level; founded
by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1850, consists almost entirely of their
shops and workmen’s houses. St. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church,
native stone, first built in 1858; second building in 1881, using the
same stone; Gothic, F. C. Withers, New York, architect; has an English
window, also one by Tiffany, “The Resurrection,” exhibited in Paris in
1900; memorial to Almet E. Read, Esq.; brick rectory and school, gift of
General John Watts De Peyster, as memorial to his daughter, first school
for advanced education in Altoona.

In the Logan House, built, 1854, by the Pennsylvania Railroad, was held
the conference of the loyal war governors in 1862, namely, A. G. Curtin,
Pennsylvania; John A. Andrew, Massachusetts; Richard Yates, Illinois;
Israel Washburn, Jr., Maine; Edward Solomon, Wisconsin; Samuel J.
Kirkwood, Iowa; O. P. Morton (by D. G. Ross, his representative),
Indiana; William Sprague, Rhode Island; F. H. Pierpont, Virginia; David
Tod, Ohio; N. S. Berry, New Hampshire; Austin Blair, Michigan; to devise
ways and means for coöperating with President Lincoln in suppressing the
Rebellion. King Edward VII, as Prince of Wales, stopped here. On the
William Penn Highway, formerly an old portage road, is site of an early
historic hotel, “Fountain Inn,” mentioned by Dickens in “American
Notes”; here William Henry Harrison stopped overnight on his way to
Washington in 1841, to be inaugurated President of the United States;
Henry Clay and Jenny Lind also stopped here.

Near junction of Sugar Run with Burgoon’s Run, three miles south of
Altoona, in 1781, Indians killed a number of militiamen from Fetter’s
Fort, built in 1775, by firing on them from ambush. A monument
dedicated in 1909, marks the place where the wife of Matthew Dean and
three of their children were killed by Indians in 1788, while he and the
other children were working in the fields. In Blair County are also
sites of Fort Roberdeau, built, 1778, and Fort Lowry, 1779, unmarked.
Magnificent views from Nopsononock, at summit of the Alleghenies,
Prospect Hill, and Kittanning Point, where the Pennsylvania Railroad is
carried around the famous Horseshoe Curve. A little farther, the
Pennsylvania Railroad passes through a tunnel two-thirds of a mile long,
2160 feet above sea level.

Lakemont Park is a noted place of scenic beauty near HOLLIDAYSBURG,
population 4071, county seat, laid out in 1820; named for James Adam
Holliday, who lived here prior to the Revolution. Courthouse,
Romanesque; built 1876-77; remodeled and enlarged in 1906; on grounds
are jail, feudal style, architect, John Haviland, and a Soldiers’
Monument. Highland Hall, stone, colonial doorway, with beautiful
grounds, is now Miss Cowles’ school for girls. Entrance to old
Presbyterian Cemetery is a Norman gate, designed by Price J. McLanahan,
Philadelphia, hewn timbers, held in place by bolts of wood, supporting a
red tiled roof. Main street is part of the old turnpike between
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, shaded by beautiful old trees; here in days
of the canal, in 1834, boats met the Portage Railroad at foot of the
Alleghenies; freight and passengers were carried over the mountain by
inclined planes and stationary engines; by this means travel from
eastern Pennsylvania was continued through the Ohio River to the
Mississippi. Charles Dickens took the trip over the mountain in 1842;
the Allegheny Portage Railroad in boldness of design and difficulty of
execution compared well with the passes of the Simplon and Mont Cenis.
“Ant Hill” woods, almost within town limits, were said to be the only
hills of the kind in this country; they were written up in the _Century_
magazine by Dr. McCook; a hill was taken to the Academy of Natural
Sciences, Philadelphia; they are now level with the ground, through
vibration of the trolley. Less than a mile from town are “Chimney
Rocks,” famous council chamber of the Indians; with view of unsurpassed
beauty of the Juniata Valley, old Portage Road, and Allegheny Mountains.
On western slope, much of the Portage Road is used for the highway; the
Monumental Arch is still standing.

SULLIVAN COUNTY


Formed March 15, 1847, named for General John Sullivan; is noted for
picturesque scenery, mountains, valleys, lakes, streams and waterfalls,
forests, and distant views. Either the scenic Williamsport and North
Branch Railroad or the state highway, that parallel each other and enter
the county near Muncy Valley, lead to beautiful Eaglesmere, 1900 feet
above sea; on Lewis Lake, one and a half miles long, one-half mile wide;
depth never definitely determined, fed by subterranean waters. About the
shore, tree bound, with luxuriant growth of rhododendron and laurel, and
rock faced to deep water, there are lovely nooks, and a bathing beach of
white sand at the northern end. Passing from Eaglesmere through
“Celestia,” where the lands were deeded in 1864, by Peter E. Armstrong
and wife, to “Almighty God”--the deed may be seen at the county
courthouse--one comes to LAPORTE, population 175; highest and smallest
county seat in Pennsylvania, 2000 feet above sea level, with its natural
beauties, including “Lake Mokoma,” is also an attractive summer resort.
It was laid out in 1850, by Michael Meylert, who owned the land and
built the first courthouse; present building, facing the park, is
Romanesque; brick; beautiful Lombardy poplar trees are in the yard.
Within the last twelve years advanced civilization has penetrated into
Sullivan County in good state highways, rural mail

[Illustration: SULLIVAN COUNTY]

routes, telephones, and several borough and township high schools. The
streets of LaPorte are wide and well kept, and the park is in care of
the Ladies’ Village Improvement Society.

At the top of the mountain, on the road toward Sonestown, is “Fiester’s
View,” where the deep valley of Muncy Creek, walled on the east by the
towering North Mountain, 3000 feet above tide, near Nordmont, is
beautiful beyond description. At the junction of the Big and Little
Loyalsock Creeks is the pretty little town of FORKSVILLE. Dr. Priestly
purchased a large tract of land about here, laid out roads, and made
many improvements. Four miles distant, on the state highway toward
Hillsgrove, on Kings Creek, is Lincoln Falls, a waterfall about 30 feet
in height at the head of a gorge with perpendicular walls of rock,
varying from 50 to 80 feet in height. A few deer, quite a number of
bear, foxes, rabbits, and squirrels are in this county; a state game
preserve is in the southeast near Jamison City. There are some good
trout streams, and the lakes are well stocked with fish. The most
valuable industry is coal from the Bernice coal fields in the east. The
production of hemlock tanned sole leather is important. Farm products
and dairying are general.

[Illustration: FOREST COUNTY]




LXI

FOREST COUNTY


Formed April 11, 1848; named for its great variety of timber; hemlock
and pine, east; dense forests of deciduous trees west along the
Allegheny River. Game large and small abounds; streams are full of brook
trout. Atmosphere is fragrant with health-giving ozone, strengthening
the weak and restoring those affected with lung trouble. Chief industry
is lumbering; in western part agriculture, and the growing of fine
apples.

David Zeisberger, first white man in Forest County, came in 1767,
Moravian missionary to the Monseys, a wild and warlike tribe; he stayed
two years in their three villages, Goshgoshunk (Holeman’s Flats),
Sa-quelin-get, Place of Council (Tionesta) and La-hun-ichannock, Meeting
of the Waters (East Hickory), and migrated with them to Fort Pitt. After
Monseys, came the Senecas under Cornplanter, in 1770. First settler
Cyrus Blood, surveyor, who cleared land for Marienville, first county
seat, and improved it. “The Big Level,” name of old state road, 1728
feet above sea, follows northeast from Marienville to Mount Jewett,
McKean County, roadbed compact and solid, 100 feet wide, was first made
in Cyrus Blood’s time. On this road is Beaver Meadows, formerly a dam
built by beavers, which backed water over an area one and one-quarter
miles long by one-eighth mile wide; dam four and one-half feet high.

Along the Guitonville road toward Marienville, on a high plateau with
two miles of straight, natural, firm roadbed, is Job’s Pinnacle, from
which is a fine distant view of Tionesta Valley; a mile farther, Pisgah,
also a pinnacle, is on Salmon Creek Hill; the whole hill is composed of
magnetic iron ore, on a sandstone foundation, above shale and slate
stratification; in surveying, the magnetic attraction is so great the
needle is paralyzed; it is a mass of rocks; another magnetic iron ore
hill is Bald Bluff, where lightning strikes freely. Stony Point, back of
Salmon Creek Hill, near Newtown Mills, is the highest land; scenery
about here is so beautiful at the mouth of Salmon Creek, that Erion
Williams, the early surveyor, called it Eden revived. Beautiful scenery
is along the State road parallel with the Sheffield & Tionesta Railroad,
crossing a large iron bridge over Tionesta Creek at Nebraska, two miles
farther, over another iron bridge, and three miles to Ross Run. This
land produces oil and gas in good quantities.

At Kellettville, on the Tionesta, pieces of ancient pottery have been
exhumed, showing that this was the home of a race older than the
Indians, who had not made pottery in this section; three miles above
Kellettville is a long sloping rock in the bed of Tionesta Creek,
“Panther Rock,” where Ebenezer Kingsley, a pioneer hunter, shot many
cougars; state paid twenty dollars bounty for a panther, twelve dollars
for a wolf. Picturesque falls are on Blue Jay Creek; near its mouth is
Rocky City, on Tionesta Creek, a vast aggregation of rocks like tall
towers, with grand scenery, nearly opposite is a prehistoric square hole
forty feet deep, no record of its formation.

TIONESTA, population 642, county seat, incorporated, 1852. Principal
buildings, Courthouse on high ground in public square of two acres,
brick, built 1870, architect, Keene Vaughn, contains proof copy of
“Zeisberger preaching to the Indians in Forest County in 1677,” engraved
by John Sartain, with a volume of Zeisberger’s Life and Notes, a gift
from the Pennsylvania Historical Society, Philadelphia; and a receipt
signed by David Zeisberger, framed in wood of the wild cherry tree under
which, legend says, he originally preached; also portraits of prominent
men of Forest County. Jail, brick and stone, in courthouse ground, built
by Van Dorn Prison Company, Cleveland, Ohio, in 1895. The Forest County
National Bank, native stone, Romanesque, built, 1899, architect, C.M.
Robinson, Altoona. Presbyterian Church, brick, 1910, on site of old
wooden church, built, 1851; and Methodist Church, brownstone, built,
1909; both contain memorial windows.

[Illustration: LAWRENCE COUNTY]




LXII

LAWRENCE COUNTY


Formed March 20, 1849; named for Perry’s flagship, in the Battle of Lake
Erie, which was named in honor of Captain James Lawrence, United States
Navy. Lawrence was mortally wounded in the War of 1812, on the frigate
_Chesapeake_, against the British ship _Shannon_; as he was carried
below he said: “Don’t give up the ship.” Chiefly settled by
Scotch-Irish. The old canal to Lake Erie, built in 1833, went through
center of the county, and did much to develop the resources--bituminous
coal, iron ore, and limestone. Chief industries, manufactories and
agriculture. Many beautiful drives are all through the county in every
direction.

The Moravian missionaries, David Zeisberger and Gottlob Senseman, were
the first white men who dwelt here, long before the county was formed;
they migrated with the Indians from Bradford County, through Forest
County, and were the greatest missionary power to them. They were
visited by Glikkikin, a renowned warrior of great eloquence, who with
his escort, purposely tried to refute the doctrines of Christianity;
they were received by Anthony, a native convert, who treated them
courteously and made such an impressive speech on Christian doctrine
that he astonished the visitors; Zeisberger, coming in then, confirmed
his words, and Glikkikin, instead of delivering his speech, replied: “I
have nothing to say. I believe your words.”

On return to his town, he advised the savages to go hear the Gospel; he
made them another visit, informed them that he had determined to embrace
Christianity, and invited them, in the name of his chief, Packauke, to
settle on land on Beaver River, near his town Kaskaskünk, now New
Castle; this land was to be for the exclusive use of the mission. The
offer was accepted, and on April 17, 1770, they left Oil Creek in
fifteen canoes; in three days they reached Fort Pitt, proceeded down the
Ohio to Beaver River, and ascended that river to the locality given, now
Moravia, passing an Indian village, near present Newport, of women, all
single and pledged never to marry.

When encamped, they sent an embassy, Zeisberger, and Abraham, a native,
to Packauke, who were received by the chief at his own house; he gave
them welcome and pledged protection; they built houses, cleared land,
planted, and prepared for winter. The Indians began to visit them, the
Monseys from Goshgoshünk were the first to cast their lot with the
Christian Indians; Glikkikin soon came and became a Christian force.
Finally the Monseys adopted Zeisberger into their tribe; the ceremony
took place at Kaskaskünk; they invested him with all the rights and
privileges of a Monsey; this proved a complete triumph and was the
source of much good influence among Indians. White settlers began to
come after Wayne’s Treaty of Greenville, in 1795.

NEW CASTLE, county seat, incorporated as a city in 1869, population
44,938, was laid out, at the junction of the Shenango, Neshannock, and
Mahoning Rivers, where they form the Beaver River, in 1798, by John C.
Stewart from New Castle, Delaware. It has natural gas, fine churches,
schools, public buildings, bridges, and many beautiful residences,
including that of Ex-Lieutenant Governor William M. Brown, on the North
Hill. Courthouse, colonial, built in 1852, in spacious grounds, on a
hill in east part of the city. The first Methodist Episcopal Church has
a memorial window to Ira D. Sankey, the singing evangelist, who was born
and lived here; subject, “Ninety and Nine”; maker, Sellars, New York;
also Hofmann’s “Christ” in stained glass. High school, brick, of best
school construction, well lighted; has reproductions on the walls of
fine works of art. The Oak Park Cemetery has some beautiful memorials.

This is one of the manufacturing communities of western Pennsylvania,
which form the greatest industrial district in the world; within a
radius of sixty miles of New Castle, the annual tonnage is over
200,000,000, while the combined annual tonnage in and out of Liverpool,
London, Hamburg, Suez Canal, and New York is 116,000,000. The American
Sheet and Tin Plate Mill is said to be the largest in the world; they
constructed a miniature playground for the only exhibit sent from New
Castle to the Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915; it showed the kind of
humanitarian work done by the company, and was representative of this
city, where the playground has done a vast amount of good among the
foreign population employed in the immense furnaces; engineering works;
and the great cement plants making 5000 barrels of Portland cement
daily. The United States Steel Corporation, Carnegie Steel Company,
maintains children’s playgrounds, with a moving picture theatre,
average attendance 1800 children daily; The “Rosena” blast furnace yard
is kept like a park in grass, flower beds, and neatness.

Cascade Park has great natural beauty. A part of the beautiful Slippery
Rock is in the southeast of this county. At Mount Jackson is Battery B
Monument in honor of the Round Head Regiment. NEW WILMINGTON, population
8861, has Westminster College, under United Presbyterian administration;
near here was the McKinley blast furnace, owned and operated by
President McKinley’s father. His son worked here as a boy.




LXIII

FULTON COUNTY


Formed April 19, 1850, named for Robert Fulton. The Tuscarora Mountains
rise like a huge barrier on the eastern boundary, with numerous other
ridges and peaks. Streams that flow into the Potomac River are largely
fed by splendid limestone springs. From the Susquehanna to the Ohio
River the scenery cannot be surpassed for picturesque beauty; far
sweeping valleys, rugged mountains, grand forests, form a constantly
changing panorama. It is both beautiful and historic. The Chambersburg
and Pittsburgh Turnpike, built in 1814-15, now the Lincoln Highway, was
first an old Indian trail from Harrisburg, through Fort Louden, Clinton
County, and westward to Bedford, crossing the center of the county.

In the days following Braddock’s defeat in 1755, this region became the
arena in which the red warrior of the forests and the white frontiersman
fought to the death. Not a valley, creek, nor mountain range, site of
modern city or town, but what was the scene of thrilling events, some of
which influence the world for all time. Early settlers were
Scotch-Irish, on the Aughwick, and in the great cove. Chief industries,
iron ore, bituminous coal, and agriculture. Dickey’s Mountain, in the
southeast, is rich in hematite and fossil ores.

MCCONNELLSBURG, county seat; population 689; land granted to William and
Daniel McConnell by

[Illustration: FULTON COUNTY]

warrant in 1762, is in the heart of the great cove; it was laid out in
1786, and in 1830 was one of the most important stopping places on the
old turnpike. Here, from 1827-47 were the Hanover Iron Works, two
furnaces, and two forges, that used hematite ore, mined from Lowry’s
Knob, one mile distant. It is said that no territory of equal extent in
this state is so rich in iron ore as is Fulton County. Fort Littleton in
the north was one of a chain of government forts from the east to Fort
Pitt. BURNT CABINS, on the old state road, was named because of the
burning of the cabins of early settlers near here by the provincial
authorities. It is said that Fulton County contributed more men to the
Civil War, in proportion, than any other county in Pennsylvania.

[Illustration: MONTOUR COUNTY]




LXIV

MONTOUR COUNTY


Formed May 3, 1850; named for Catharine Montour; surface hilly;
traversed by several barren ridges. Muncy Hills lie along the northwest
border, while down the river for miles stretches the Montour Ridge,
furnishing quantities of best iron ore; there is also finest limestone;
and much fertile land, drained by the Chillisquaque and Mahoning creeks.
Chief industries are iron and steel production, and manufactories. Here,
it is said, the first “T” rail was made, in 1844, and the first cannon
in the United States, made of anthracite iron, was cast at the foundry
in 1842.

DANVILLE, county seat; population 6952; was settled in 1790; beautifully
located, it nestles between Bald Top and Blue Hill. Mahoning Creek,
named after a tribe of Indians who peopled this part of the country,
flows through the town, which is built on part of the tract of land
surveyed on warrant of John Penn to John Lukens, Surveyor General of the
United States, dated, January 31, 1769. A bridge built by the state in
1904 is one-quarter mile long and connects Montour with Northumberland
County; at its entrance is River Front Park, laid out in 1912, with
concrete walks, flower beds, and fountain. Market Street Park, center of
town, has an electrically lighted fountain. Memorial Park, a beautiful
knoll, was formerly the burial ground of the Presbyterian Church; in
1908 it was laid out as a park with flower beds, and is kept up by the
council and public-spirited citizens; the Soldiers’ Monument is here,
with two cannon of the Civil War near.

Courthouse, Georgian, built in 1871. Jail built, 1892, architect, J. H.
Brugler, has modern equipment, and for months at a time is empty. Among
the fifteen churches, the most notable in architecture is Christ
Memorial, Protestant Episcopal, fourteenth century, English Gothic;
massive architecture, native limestone of varied tints, with Ohio stone
for the traceried windows. The Thomas Beaver Free Library. Young Men’s
Christian Association with gymnasium and swimming pool; George F.
Geisinger Memorial Hospital; and State Hospital for the Insane,
constructed by S. S. Schultz, M.D., corner-stone laid by Governor Geary
in 1869, are all important buildings, among the best equipped and most
modern in the state. WASHINGTONVILLE is site of Fort Bossley, on the
Chillisquaque Creek.




LXV

SNYDER COUNTY


Formed March 2, 1855, named for Hon. Simon Snyder, Governor of
Pennsylvania, 1808-17; three terms; noted as the first governor to urge
legislation for free public schools; he was the great war governor of
1812; served in the Assembly from 1789-1808, and was speaker of the
House from 1802-08; he lived at Selinsgrove. From end of Northumberland
Bridge, built by Theodore Burr in 1814, on West Branch of the
Susquehanna; the road leading south to Selinsgrove passes Blue Hill,
noted for beautiful scenery. On top was formerly Hotel Shikellimy,
burned in 1895; on one of the rocks overhanging is a natural profile
named for Shikellimy, who sauntered about here. Farther on is a single
arch stone bridge; for half a mile, beginning at this bridge, is a state
road built by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Governor Pennypacker
handled the first shovel of dirt in 1904; it was laid out first by James
F. Linn in 1829, has since been extended.

SELINSGROVE, first settlers, in 1755, were all killed by Indians, laid
out by and named for Anthony Selin in 1827, population 1937; Governor
Snyder mansion, built by himself in 1816, is near center of town,
colonial, massive stone walls, with arched door ten feet high and large
side porch, in well kept grounds. Due west from Selinsgrove, towards
Middleburg, is Susquehanna University, formerly Missionary Institute;

[Illustration: SNYDER COUNTY]

collegiate and theological courses, six large and several small
buildings; main building, Selinsgrove Hall, was built in 1859, Gustavus
Adolphus Hall in 1895, contains collection of forty-two pictures of
Gustavus Adolphus, also brass memorial tablet to the men appointed in
1856, by the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Maryland, to organize the
Missionary Institute; the buildings contain portraits of Governor Simon
Snyder, members of the faculty, and other Lutheran clergymen; on the
campus is a granite Celtic cross, marking grave of the founder, Benjamin
Kurtz, D.D., LL.D.; in the old Lutheran Cemetery is grave of Governor
Snyder, Quincy granite monument, surmounted with his bust, life size,
erected by the state in 1885.

Two miles west is SALEM; Row’s Church, log, built, 1780, modernized in
1897. In KREAMER is the old brick hotel used for special sessions of
court before 1855, for cases in immediate neighborhood; a short distance
in the field stands the old block house, erected before 1781, where
white settlers gathered in defense against Indians. One mile farther
west, in 1781, Indians killed five members of the Stock family. Ten
miles west from Selinsgrove is MIDDLEBURG, county seat; 498 feet above
sea level; population 984; laid out in 1800. In Glendale Cemetery is
grave of Hon. George Kreamer, nephew of Governor Snyder, and member of
the Legislature, 1812-13; member of Congress, 1823-27; also grave of
Captain Frederick Evans, member of State Legislature, 1810-11, a
defender of Fort McHenry, Baltimore, where, in 1814, the “Star-Spangled
Banner” was written by Francis Scott Key.

On the banks of Stump’s Run is shaft monument to soldiers and sailors of
this country who fought in the different wars; erected in 1904, by
county commissioners; Soldiers’ Memorial Building, open to the public,
is near the Lutheran Church; it was dedicated 1908; interior lined with
marble, names of all soldiers and sailors of Snyder County are preserved
within its walls, John F. Stetler, architect. Wooden bridge across
Middle Creek, in good repair, is said to have been built in 1808 by John
Aurand. Two miles west of town are the Hassinger Lutheran Churches,
General Council east, present building erected in 1871, third on
original site, first building in 1785; a split occurred, and the General
Synod members built, in 1782, a quarter mile west; present church, in
1915.

Almost due south is PAXTONVILLE, 510 feet above sea level; has wooden
bridge over Middle Creek, built in 1851, John Bilger, builder; and ruins
of Beaver blast furnace, once busiest industry in Middle Creek Valley,
erected by Hon. Ner Middleswarth, the Kern Brothers and John C. Wilson,
1848-56; it was operated until 1866, power secured from a 200-foot head
of water, running over two overshot wheels, one over the other. Westward
is farm of Ner Feese on which gold and silver were discovered.
BEAVERTOWN; population 525; 651 feet; originally Swifttown, named for
John Swift, who had the land patented in 1760; was residence of Hon. Ner
Middleswarth from 1792; he was reëlected thirteen times member of
Legislature, twice speaker of the House--in 1828 and 1836; member of
Congress, 1853-55; his last public service was that of associate judge.
BEAVER SPRINGS, elevation 591 feet, laid out in 1806, early chief
industry, ore mines. Scenic beauty from Shade Mountain, a long ridge,
summit near Beaver Springs, 1672 feet above sea level. MCCLURE, six
miles west, is where folding houses are manufactured; the largest ever
made was produced here, and shipped to South America.

[Illustration: CAMERON COUNTY]




LXVI

CAMERON COUNTY


Formed March 29, 1860; named in honor of Hon. Simon Cameron, state
senator at that time. Situated among the spurs of the Alleghenies,
altitude varies from 794 feet to 2100 feet above sea level. The
Sinnemahoning Creek and its tributaries drain three quarters of the
county into the Susquehanna; along these waters, roads were cut and
towns built for the extensive early lumbering and tanning operations;
primeval forests of hemlock, oak, cherry, elm, and some of the finest
white pine in the state. Beds of coal and fire clay still await
development. Salt spring and a mineral spring of rare medicinal value
are near SIZERVILLE. The county is now largely given up to the
manufacture of high explosives, nitro-gelatine, smokeless powder, gun
cotton, picric acid; in 1915 there was a merger of four powder companies
who created a plant of vast proportions, over one hundred buildings,
extending from the edge of Emporium, for over a mile, along the banks of
Driftwood Creek.

EMPORIUM, county seat; population 3036; incorporated 1861; altitude 1031
feet above sea level; first settled in 1811, as Shippen, name changed
through deference to an old tradition; in 1785, an agent of the Holland
Land Company, owning large territories in Pennsylvania and New York,
removed the bark from a tree where the town now stands, and carved the
word, “Emporium.” A typical mountain town, the streets follow the
winding way of Driftwood Stream, or climb the mountain side where
magnificent views of scenic grandeur await the beholder. Best
architecture, the Episcopal Church, brown stone, English chapel design,
Cram & Ferguson, of Boston, architects, built in 1901; other
denominations have modern brick buildings. The large brick courthouse,
built, 1890, is in a park on the hillside, overlooking the town; in the
grounds is monument to soldiers of the Civil War.

CAMERON, in 1889, one hundred coke ovens, “beehive” design, were built
here to coke the coal in the near-by hills, for the blast furnace at
Emporium; now abandoned, and today mountain wild flowers blossom along
the row of silent hearths. STERLING RUN; in this quaint village belongs
the honor of the first church in the county, Presbyterian, “The Pine
Street Church,” erected in 1826, so-called in consequence of the old
Pine Street Church, Philadelphia, contributing funds to pay the workmen
and buy the windows; the lumber and much of the construction being
donated by the pioneers; built of hewn pine logs, chinked with plaster
of moss and mud, and fastened with hand-wrought nails, this little
chapel endures, while those who shaped it sleep in the little churchyard
at its threshold.

DRIFTWOOD, near the “Crescent,” a half moon shaped mountain forming
sides of the valley for nearly three points of the compass; claims the
first settlement by white man within the county, in 1804; in the center
of the village, facing the Sinnemahoning Creek, is the “Bucktail”
Monument, in memory of Cameron’s sons who fought for the Union, erected
by the state in 1908, inscription, “From this town, on April 27, 1861,
the Cameron, Elk and McKean County Rifles, under leadership of Thomas L.
Kane, afterwards Commanding Officer of the Regiment, later a
Major-General, embarked on four rafts for Harrisburg, where they were
mustered into the service of the State, and formed the nucleus, about
which the Bucktail Regiment of the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps was
organized; which during its time of service, was almost continuously
attached to the army of the Potomac.”

SINNEMAHONING (Stony-lick), site of an Indian village called “The
Lodge,” the battle ground of Peter Grove, famous Indian fighter, a
picturesquely beautiful spot. Here were born the beautiful Clafflin
sisters, Lady Cook (Tennesee Clafflin), and Mrs. Martin Woodhull
(Victoria Clafflin), now a wealthy philanthropist in England; their
father, Buckman Clafflin, a pioneer, opened the first store in the
county in 1829.

Formed August 13, 1878; named for the great Lackawanna coal basin; an
Indian word, signifying “The Forks of a Stream.” Chief industry,
anthracite coal mining, confined to the long-depressed trough forming
the Lackawanna Valley and to the mountains bordering it on both sides,
with Bald Mountain, in Lackawanna Range, 2250 feet high, and Big Stoney
among the Moosic Mountains, 2230 feet. Originally settled by Connecticut
people who disputed the right of Pennsylvania to jurisdiction; life and
growth have been the result of the coal-mining industry, which brought
into it large numbers of Welsh, Irish, German, English, and Scotch,
whose descendants dominate the region; latterly have come Polish, Slavs,
Italians, and Lithuanians, a heterogeneous but rapidly assimilating
mining population.

The mining of anthracite coal began at Carbondale in the early twenties;
the old No. 1 plane is marked with monument and tablets; coal was taken
over the Moosic Mountains to Honesdale, Wayne County, by steep inclined
planes, up which the loaded cars were drawn by ropes or cables, and the
empty cars let down; thence by canal to Roundout, on the Hudson; on the
levels, between planes, cars were drawn by horses; later a descending
grade was given to the tracks over which the cars ran by gravity; a
similar gravity railroad near Scranton, carried coal to the Delaware &
Hudson Canal at Hawley, below Honesdale, both now abandoned for steam
roads.

The country northwest has well-cultivated farm lands; that, southeast,
blends with the Pocono Highlands, is wild and picturesque; an almost
unbroken wilderness for thirty miles, excepting along the line of the
Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad; on both sides of this road are
good highways; the main road, the whole length of the valley, is
exceptionally fine. The road from Gouldsboro Station was built by Jay
Gould, 1855, when he was interested with Mr. Pratt in a tannery at
Gouldsboro (now Thornhurst).

At Carbondale, crossing Moosic Mountains, is road to Honesdale,
following the line of the old Delaware & Hudson gravity road; at
Dundaff, about five miles north of Carbondale, this road runs along the
edge of Crystal Lake, near are the Twin Knobs of Elk Hill, about 2500
feet high. A point of geologic interest is the Archbald Pot Hole, said
to be largest of the kind in this country; a cylindrical hole twenty
feet deep, by thirty feet wide, eroded in the ice age through the
overlying rocks down to the coal measures.

SCRANTON, county seat, population 137,783; laid out on site of an Indian
village, Muncy Tribe; began as an iron town; iron in large quantities
was found in the hills three miles south of the city, and a suitable
quality of limestone was also supposed to exist there; but the coal
business superseded; the old ore mine, and abandoned road to furnaces at
Scranton, are of historic and picturesque interest.

The courthouse, on Washington Avenue near center of town, stands in a
square of ground, Romanesque, West Mountain stone, built 1881-84,
architect, S. G. Perry. St. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church. Wyoming
Avenue near Linden Street, Gothic, West Mountain stone, built 1866-71,
architect, R. M. Upjohn, New York; contains Tiffany mosaic panel, back
of font, “Baptism of Christ,” also Tiffany window in chancel, “The
Ascension.” St. Peter’s Cathedral, at corner of Wyoming Avenue and
Linden, Italian Renaissance, brick, built, 1866, architect, Joel Amsden;
remodeled 1883 by Durand, Philadelphia. Administration Building of the
International Correspondence Schools, Wyoming Avenue between Vine and
Mulberry Streets, Gothic, West Mountain stone, built in 1898; architect,
W. Scott Collins; window by Kenyon Cox, made in 1898, “Science
Instructing Industry.”

The Scranton Public Library (Albright Memorial) is placed as an accent
of beauty, corner of Washington Avenue and Vine Street, French chateau
style, fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, after Cluny Museum, Paris;
gray Indiana limestone and brown Madina stone laid in coursed ashlar,
built in 1893; architects, Green & Wicks, Buffalo, New York; contains
portraits of Joseph J. Albright, painted in 1902, artist, Bayard Henry
Tyler; and of John J. Albright, artist, Chartrain, France; stained glass
windows are illustrative of celebrated book bindings in the past; a
marble mosaic floor is in the entrance hall.

Second Presbyterian Church, Jefferson Avenue between Vine and Mulberry
Streets, Romanesque; West, Mountain stone, built 1885; has Tiffany
windows, “Charity” and “Hope.” Madison Avenue Synagogue, near Vine
Street; Byzantine, West Mountain stone, built 1902, architect, George
W. Kramer, New York. First Presbyterian Church, corner of Madison Avenue
and Olive Street, perpendicular Gothic, Indiana limestone; built 1903,
architect, Holden, New York; windows by John La Farge, “The Woman at the
Well”; and by Tiffany, “The Ascension”; Tiffany mosaic, “Pentecost.”
Immanuel Baptist Church, corner of Jefferson Avenue and Mulberry Street,
Gothic, Hummelstown redstone, built 1909, architect, Edward Langley,
Scranton. Elm Park Church, corner of Linden and Jefferson Streets,
Romanesque, West Mountain stone, built 1892, architect, George W.
Kramer.

Lackawanna Railroad Station, Lackawanna and Jefferson Avenues,
Renaissance, Indiana limestone, granite base, built 1909, architects,
Kenneth Murchison, New York, and Edward Langley; has interior finishings
of Grueby tiles; and mosaic mural panels of views along the Lackawanna
Railroad. The Everhart Museum of Natural History, Science and Art, in
Nay Aug Park, south end of Milberry Street, given by the late Dr. I. F.
Everhart, and sustained by generous endowment; Renaissance, terra-cotta,
built 1908, architects, Blackwood & Nelson; contains also the Hollister
collection of Indian curios. Much natural beauty centers about the water
supply system of the Scranton Gas and Water Company, which has over ten
miles of fine driveways, including the road to top of Mount Anonymous,
overlooking the lake; and Long Swamp Drive and roads up about Scrub Oak
Mountain.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
